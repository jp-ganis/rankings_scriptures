For an age Chaos ruled, corrupting the Mortal
Realms as the minions of the Dark Gods ran
rampant. Yet even as civilisation was ground
into ruin, a new hope was born. A new era
began as the God-King Sigmar opened up the
Heavens and sent
forth his Stormcast Eternals.
They fought
for order and for justice, and once
more civilisation blossomed. Across the realms,
oppressed survivors rose to join the battle.

The shock of Sigmar’s storm was mighty, yet
the corruptions of Chaos were deeply rooted.
The foe was too numerous and too powerful
for
the God-King’s Stormhosts to vanquish alone,
and so he sought out other deities, hoping to
forge a Great Alliance of Order as there once
was of old.

From Shyish,
the Realm of Death,
the Great
Necromancer Nagash gazed out from eye sockets
long hollowed. Through many battles and
hardships,
the Supreme Lord of the Undead had
endured the Age of Chaos.
In the beginning,
Nagash had fought side by side with Sigmar,
but the God-King had betrayed him. Even now,
Sigmar spoke of
justice while withholding
souls that were Nagash’s rightful due as Lord
of the Underworlds. Never again would Nagash
bow before another… he would show them the
meaning of true order.

As his machinations drew to their conclusion,
Nagash came close to achieving supremacy, but
Chaos once again thwarted his ultimate mastery.
Overcome with cold fury at
the desecration of
his final ritual,
the Great Necromancer sent
forth his undead legions, raising a new spectral
host to lead his assault.

And the Mortal Realms trembled…

THAT WHICH HAUNTS THE NIGHT

THAT WHICH
HAUNTS THE NIGHT

An indomitable new malevolence has stirred an ancient terror. No longer content to hunt
civilisation’s edges, phantasmal forces gather into spectral armies. This is no mere haunting but a
shock assault that seeks nothing less than to destroy life itself.

A fell wind is rising. From
the darkest pits of Shyish,
the Realm of Death, comes
a storm of ethereal figures.
An eerie mist spreads before
them, blotting out the sun.
They muster upon corpse-
strewn battlefields or ancient
burial grounds, a ghostly army
of phantoms. They are the
supernatural, the dead, the
damned – the Nighthaunts.

Sustained by a fathomless
hatred for the living, these
wraiths fight to send fresh
souls screaming down into the
darkened realms from whence
the dead emerged, taking
cruel pleasure in knowing
the torments that await their
victims below.

And by the manner of their
death shall ye know them…

MALIGNANT SPIRITS

The Nighthaunts are the
horrors that haunt the
periphery, terrors that prowl
beyond life’s edge. They wait
with the patience of the eternal,
yet their hunger drives them
with insatiable needs – to hunt,
to harm, to destroy life – for
that is all that is left to them.
They come in many forms, but
all are destined to forever stalk
the Mortal Realms and to drag
the living to the same doom.

The Nighthaunts have not only
lost their lives, but also their
physical bodies. While mortal
flesh rots away,
the spirit lives,
taking on a new, phantasmal
aspect. Whatever blissful
underworld rest or eternal
peace that was promised to
these souls has turned out to
be naught but lies. Instead,

Nighthaunts are fated with
afterlives of damnation,
stripped of any compassion
they had before death. All
warmth is eradicated,
leaving
behind only the negative.
What remains of their spirit is
bitter, hate-filled and bound
by necromancy, often in some
cruelly ironic way linked to
either their deaths or their
deeds in life. They must forever
haunt the Mortal Realms, to
seek out and punish those who
dare to still
live.

Glowing with a fell light, the
Nighthaunts are a bone-
chilling sight. They appear
nebulous and insubstantial,
able to hover weightlessly in
the air or pass through solid
obstacles. A Nighthaunt can
glide without pause straight
through a wall as a man might
stride unimpeded through
light fog. Unless guided by
supreme faith, enemy blades
and arrows pass harmlessly
through the Nighthaunts’
incorporeal forms.

Only those that can steel their
minds and drive out their
deepest fears can stand against
such supernatural horrors. It
takes unstinting courage to wi l l
a weapon to pierce a phantasm.
In return, the chill blades of

the Nighthaunts reap a deadly
toll upon the living. Skeletal
hands reach out, ignoring
armour, flesh and bone alike to
grasp at a foe’s heart. The fear
and confusion that emanates
from each of the unholy
gheists robs enemies of their
physical strength just as it saps
their conviction.

Though almost impervious to
physical harm, Nighthaunts
carr y with them their own
hell. Some are cursed by the
dark manner of their death.
For instance, those who met
their ends in chains might
have hoped to escape their
captivity in the afterlife, yet in
the spiritual world are bound
by more manacles than ever.
Others find their deeds in life
turned against them – a mortal
who spent a lifetime healing
and nurturing might find
that, as a spirit, they can only
wantonly destroy. Such morbid
rewards fill the Nighthaunts
with rage and hatred.

The perpetrator of these
eternal torments is none
other than Nagash, god of
the underworlds, the Great
Necromancer,
the Supreme
Lord of the Undead and self-
proclaimed ruler of Shyish.
Nagash finds the twisted
irony he has inflicted to be
naught but poetic justice. His
vindictive nature,
limitless
spite and unfathomable ego
have created the most terrible
of spirits, gheists and wraiths.

A single Nighthaunt might
terrorise a village, and a pair
acting together could leave
an entire fiefdom quaking
in fear. When gathered en
masse and united beneath a

greater undead spirit, such an
army can destroy an empire,
and become the stuff of
dire legends.

THE PROCESSIONS

Nighthaunt armies are known
as processions. Fear runs
before them as tangible as the
unnatural mist that rises from
the ground. The air grows chill
and then, from out of nowhere
they come, riding on the wind.
They surge over the land like a
phantasmal tide.

Some of the wraithly host ride
upon spectral steeds, their
hooves never touching the
earth but leaving footprints of
cold fire in the skies. Horrible
lurching shapes hover, moving
in disjointed fashion, but
travelling terribly fast for
all that. There are rank after
rank of ethereal crook-backed
things, cowled creatures
brandishing tall glaives. Others
come in chains, rattling and
moaning. Ghastly apparitions
leer from tattered hoods,
spectral scythes sweep forward,
while mind-splitting howls
and harrowing shrieks echo
through the gloom.

Many foes flee at the first sight
of a Nighthaunt procession.
Others hold their ground for
a time, but it does not take
long before senses sharpened
by fear begin to make out
sinuous shapes moving in the
thickening fog. Panicking
defenders leap at every new
swirl – and they are right
to. Clawed talons reach out,
phantom riders appear out of
the sinister vapours, and spirits

materialise from unexpected
quarters, drifting through trees
or over untraversable moats.

The Nighthaunt onslaught is
not merely a physical assault,
but a psychological one as well,
and only the bravest dare to
stand before them.

RISING THREAT

Once, Nighthaunts were the
stuff of myths and fables. Tales
told of specific hauntings,
such as the Bloody-handed
Baron that stalked the ruins
of Fornorn castle, or spine-
chilling events like the return
of the Shrill Sisters, who
came back to massacre the
village that burnt them as
witches. Every region of the
Mortal Realms could boast
bloodcurdling tales or gheist-

frequented sites. In addition
to these lone revenants,
Nighthaunts could also be
seen bound to the service of
a Necromancer or Soulblight
vampire, but most stalked
the lands of the living purely
under their own malevolence.
That was before cataclysmic
events in Shyish opened up
a nightmare. Nighthaunts
flooded the Mortal Realms,
rising up unexpectedly to
strike fear in the hearts of
all mortal creatures. Seeing
the effectiveness of these
sudden shock attacks, Nagash
organised a new wing of his
legions. The Nighthaunts would
be his outriders of horror,
the
first wave for his long-planned
Soul Wars. To command this
new vanguard of terror, Nagash
appointed a new leader – Lady
Olynder, Mortarch of Grief.

W ith amazement, the guards of Griffon Tower
watched one of their brethren stagger out of the
forest. Opening the shim-field por tcullis they
raced out to aid the injured warrior, who by his armour and
markings was par t of the Vanguard-Hunter
retinue that
had been on patrol to the nor th. His body-plate was unrent,
but his helm was missing, and his haggard face told a tale of
agony and terror. Struggling against those who sought to hold
him up, the Stormcast seemed not to recognise them at first.
Then, his wide eyes appeared to focus and he struggled to say
something, but for minutes no words came.
‘They are coming!’ he spoke at last, his face conveying pure
horror. And then, his final message delivered, he could hold
on no longer and was gone. His body shifted to azure light, a
beam that blinked up to the heavens, leaving no trace.
‘I have never seen a foe cause such fear in one of us,’
said
Metallus.
‘What could it be? ’ The question stood unanswered.
As one the Liberators returned to the gatehouse with many
glances cast towards the black forest behind them.
‘Whatever is coming,’
said Liberator-Prime Augustus,
‘they will find they can’t get past us and the walls of Griffon
Tower.’ As the enchanted por tcullis shut behind them a chill
wind swept from the nor th, the air itself seeming to moan in
protest. A mist rose, impossibly fast, its unnatural green-
tinged sw irls seeming to hide ominous shapes. A horn of Azyr
sounded and from the top tower came the staccato repor ts of
the longstrike crossbows opening fire.
Even as the Liberators peered out into the fog the foe was
upon them – charging through the walls came cowled spectres
brandishing gleaming scy thes. Grinning skeletal apparitions
wreathed in balefire were the last things the Stormcast
Eternals saw, before they vanished back to Sigmaron to
be remade anew. Soon, no defenders stood between the
Nighthaunts and the townships beyond the tower’s walls.


PAGEBREAK
From out of the rising fog comes a deathly procession of Shyish. They are the riders in the dark, the takers of souls,
the Nighthaunts. By the time the wraiths emerge from the mist it is too late – too late for protective rhymes, too late
for the sign of the Hammer. All is macabre, all is death. Ask not for whom the reaper comes – he comes for thee.

THE RESTLESS DEAD

THE RESTLESS DEAD

There are many different types of undead, and there is much speculation amongst those learned in
the arcane arts about such entities and their maker. As necromancy is a dark and often forbidden
subject, few mortals know the true extent of its rituals, and it is often fatal to learn too much.

Across the Mortal Realms the
dead do not rest easy. Unquiet
spirits haunt and terrorise the
living, re-animated cadavers
rise from their graves at the
bidding of Necromancers, and
immortal Soulblight vampires
plot nefarious schemes of
conquest while draining
mortal blood for sustenance.
A dread figure casts a long
shadow over all – Nagash,
father of necromancy, god of
the underworlds, and ruler
supreme of all undead.

HATRED OF LIFE

Nighthaunt spirits are
many and var ied, but
a l l have one thing in
common – a hatred of
the living . Some,
like
the Cairn Wraiths, were
as wicked in life as they
are in death – a l l but
their most vi le traits
have eroded away,
their
hate st i l l cling ing to
them and dr iv ing them
onwards. Others,
like the
Glaivewraith Sta lkers
and Chainrasps , are
embittered by the curse
of their afterlife,
for
now they are yoked to
an eternity of torment
and their jealousy of the
living is bound less. They
are goaded to destroy a l l
that st i l l draws breath –
some are even mistaken ly
convinced that doing
so w i l l earn them a
reprieve. Yet such is not
the nature of Nagash.
For a few spirits,
like the
Dreadscythe Harr idans ,
the hatred is integra l
to their curse, for they
cannot control
themselves
and must watch helplessly
the horrors they are
compelled to commit.

UNDEATH

Those that dare to study the
forbidden arts of death magic
– curious wizards, wayward
apprentices and would-be
Necromancers – generally
accept that there are three
main ways to create undead.
The first and most common
of these is the enslavement of
the deceased’s remains – the
necro-evocus. Zombies and
skeletons – worm-eaten corpses
and desiccated bones – can
be reinvigorated through
necromantic incantations.
There is no life or personality
in such risen creatures, merely
dark magic that binds their
bodies to a wi l l greater than
their own.

The second way in which
undead are created is the
necro-procratus – undead
making more undead. The
simplest version of this is the
bite of a zombie, which can
infect the stricken so that upon
their death they too rise up.
There are several variations
of necro-procratus, some
involving organised ritual.

The third method of creating
undead is the most complex
– the necro-maledictus. This
takes the form of a powerful
eldritch curse cast upon a
soul that has been recently
separated from its physical
body. These hexes can var y by
region and culture throughout
the Mortal Realms, but in all
cases they consign a terrible
fate upon the spirit. Instead
of passing onwards into the
underworlds, the afflicted spirit
wi l l instead remain on the
mortal plane, doomed to haunt
it for eternity.

The scholars of the Collegiate
Arcane widely believe that all
necromantic magic originated

from Nagash and the mortific
spells he devised. However,
there are instances of natural
phenomena, such as drifting
pockets of amethyst magic or
particularly rich veins of grave-
sand,
leading to the creation of
Nighthaunts as well.

Souls become so twisted by
death magic that they take
ominous new forms, becoming
ghostly killers intent on
destroying the living. There are
many varieties of Nighthaunt,
with hundreds of different
maledictions creating distinct
phantasmal beings, some of
which are believed to be unique
in nature. The great majority
of Nighthaunts, however,
fall
into one of about a dozen broad
categories – specific types of
wraiths such as the spiritually
imprisoned Chainrasp Hordes,
the cursed healers known as
Dreadscythe Harridans, or the
mass-grave amalgamations
known as Spirit Hosts.

There is a twisted and dramatic
irony to the fates of those souls
cursed to become Nighthaunts.
One who lost their family and
their own life to base betrayal
might be cursed to an afterlife
where they unflinchingly serve
the killer that took ever ything
from them. A criminal bound
in chains that came to long for
his life to end so that he might
know freedom may find his
spirit self still weighed down
with stocks and manacles
for evermore.

It is Nagash that is behind these
cruelties. He is unforgiving to
a degree mortalkind cannot
fathom. However, he does not
mete out punishments out
of the boredom of eternity,
nor does he play with souls
for his own amusement, for
such concepts are anathema

THE THORNY BRIAR

Thorny briar is a plant commonly associated with
undead, and with the Nighthaunts in particular. Its barbs
represent the spirits’ eternal pain and the cruelty of their
existence, whilst the grave roses that sometimes appear
on its stems further denote death, tragedy and bleakness.
The vine’s creepers endlessly curl into knots, allegorical
of the inescapable plight of these revenant spirits and the
hopelessness of their fate, for although the necromantic forces
holding Nighthaunts together can be broken by sorcery,
or violence driven by sufficient willpower, over time their
shattered essence reforms in the underworlds of Shyish and
they return to their morbid un-life. There are few weapons
or spells in the Mortal Realms powerful enough to destroy a
Nighthaunt once and for all.

to the Great Necromancer. To
Nagash’s
cold yet orderly mind,
the macabre penances to which
the Nighthaunts are subjected
are but justice, for there is not
a single mote of mercy within
his being. To the God of Death,
mortals that attempt to escape
fate or thwart his designs
deserve the very harshest
of dooms.

Over the centuries Nagash has
invented many different curses
to punish deserving souls
that enter the underworlds.
Some of these powerful hexes
linger in perpetuity,
lurking in
the underworlds like spiders,
waiting for similarly marked
souls so that they might latch
onto them as well.

Something Wicked
This Way Comes

SOMETHING WICKED
THIS WAY COMES

The Mortal Realms have always been stalked by the spirits of the dead, but they are now flooded
with Nighthaunt creatures like never before. This is the unintended result of a plot that has been
under way since the realms were young. Thus is born a new era of terror…

In all the realms there have
always been hauntings – the
scratching at the shuttered
window,
the creaking opening
of latched doors, the mysterious
light that beckons from the
swamp. These phenomena are
caused by lesser gheists, the
shadows of spirits, and the
residual ill wi l l of vengeful
mortals that have passed on
to the afterlife. Yet
there are
other,
far more powerful spirits
from beyond.

Those entities known as
Nighthaunts are undead that
possess far greater animus and
influence than troublesome
poltergheists or apparitions
of mourning. Nighthaunts
come back from the dead
not to antagonise,
lament or
memorialise, but to vent their
anger – to ki l l the living and to
send their souls screaming back
to the same eternal torments
to which they themselves
are subject.

Throughout the ages, some
Nighthaunts have become
creatures of dread and legend,
and the living tell many tales
of their hauntings. Some of
these creatures – such as Cairn
Wraiths and Tomb Banshees
– would occasionally be
discovered by Necromancers
or Soulblight vampires. These
powerful undead bound into
servitude such Nighthaunts,
harnessing and directing the
spectres’ destructive tendencies
for their own ends.

On rare occasions,
like the
unholy anniversaries of great
cataclysms or intense influxes
of amethyst magic, entire
Nighthaunt hosts would arise.
Whole towns were known
to have disappeared before

the wrath of these ethereal
armies, but luckily such
supernatural eruptions were
few and far between. At least,
that was the case before the
Shyish necroquake.

PLAN OF AGES

Nagash’s plans for domination
began when he awoke during
the time known as the Age
of Myth. It was then that
the Great Necromancer first
claimed Shyish, yet it was
not only the underworlds of
the Realm of Death that the
god coveted.

Nagash’s plan for ultimate
supremacy was a subtle one,
and required an immense
amount of time, magical power
and tireless labour – all things
the Great Necromancer held
in abundance. To harness the
necessary arcane energies,
Nagash sought out grave-sand
– the realmstone of Shyish that
was solidified death magic in
its purest form.

As with each of the realms,
magical energy was not evenly
spread throughout the lands
of Shyish, but rather could be
found in far greater quantity
and quality at the Realm’s
Edge. Thus, in Shyish, the
greatest abundance of grave-
sand was found heaped in
dunes along the very periphery
of its domains. It is commonly

believed that each mortal
creature has their own stream
of grave-sand, and that, so long
as its grains trickle down the
dunes, their life wi l l continue.
Should that sandstream fail,
however,
the mortal life is
likewise ended. Those who
might attempt to travel to that
region of Shyish to ensure a
continuous flow of sand put
themselves in dire peril, for
there amethyst magic waxes
so strong that hurricanes of
baleful power sweep the dunes,
destroying any living thing that
dares to intrude.

While a mortal creature could
not last long beneath the
lashing ending-power of so
much concentrated amethyst
magic, the same cannot be said
for the undead. Nagash sent
his minions – endless lines of
skeletons – into the dunes to
collect the precious resource.
They proved able to survive
the trek into those forlorn
territories, but still, each could
only carr y a single speck of
realmstone, for even they could
not stand indefinitely against
such arcane might.

Over many centuries, countless
skeletal figures made the
journey, relentlessly marching
to retrieve their one grain of
grave-sand before returning.
It was a journey of countless
thousands of leagues, and
many were lost, crumbling
to dust beneath the magical
barrage, waylaid by skaven
raiders, or beset by any number
of the terminus creatures – the
dreadful undead beasts that
stalk those regions. Others
simply continued to trudge,
then crawl, until their limbs
were ground down to nothing
and they could move no more.

As the centuries rolled by,
Nagash amassed a vast store
of grave-sand. Mountains
of the realmstone were used
to construct a monumental
masterwork – an echo of the
Black Pyram id of the world-
that-was. Yet
this pyramid
was built inverted, held aloft
by complex spells of binding.
Its tip hovered but a hand’s
span above the ground,
and it soared upwards to a
towering height.

Warning signs of the vast
accumulation of death magic
were perceived by those attuned
to the arcane. Malign portents
caused armies from across
the Mortal Realms and the
Realm of Chaos to be mustered
against Nagash’s growing
power. Shyish was invaded
from hundreds of points. With
the pyramid’s construction
nearing completion, the many
battles fought to waylay the
Lord of Undeath at last took a
toll – the skaven unwittingly

disrupted the orderly workings
of Nagash’s
arcane edifice,
resulting in a cataclysmic shift.
The inverted pyramid began to
spin, and the flow of amethyst
magic in Shyish was altered,
drawn from the Realm’s
Edge to the epicentre of the
vast monument.

THE NECROQUAKE

The explosion of magic that
ensued was beyond even
Nagash’s
abilities to control. A
mind-splitting wave of eldritch
power shook the Mortal Realms
and ripped at the very fabric
that tied them together. A wave
of death magic washed over the
cosmos. In each realm, spectres
and fell spirits long dormant
were roused to vengeful action,
attacking with no plan other
than to sink their dagger-
like talons into the living.
Billions of dead souls rose up
anew, assailing anything that
still breathed with a hatred
beyond comprehension.

This was the necroquake of
Shyish and it altered the Mortal
Realms forever.

In Shyish, the Great Black
Pyramid absorbed so much
amethyst magic it began to
sink, buckling the underworlds
in a whirlpool of downwards-
pulling energies. So was the
Shyish Nadir born, drawing
all souls towards it. Not
even Nagash could master
its energies.

While his plans to fill himself
with enough arcane power to
conquer the Mortal Realms
had gone awry, Nagash had
flooded everywhere with the
undead. On a grand scale the
Great Necromancer saw the
fu l l might of wraith hosts
unleashed, and the terror
they caused. There were more
such spirits roaming the lands
than ever, although their
attacks were more instinctive
than planned. But that would
soon change…

powers to sustain the unnatural state of
undeath itself. When filled with grave-sand
and imbued with dark powers from the
retronovis ritual – a powerful incantation of
reversal – an hourglass can reinvigorate the
necromantic magic that binds the undead. A
powerful enough version of the spell can even
have strange temporal effects, slowing the
foe down to a nightmarish crawl from which
they cannot escape, or even aging them in
rapid fashion.

SYMBOLS OF DEATH

Even the greatest of mortals eventually falls,
like autumnal
leaves, to mix with the dirt
below. Throughout the different cultures of
the Mortal Realms there are many symbols
associated with death, such as the purple
grave rose, the gnarlyew tree, the thorny –
sometimes bleeding – briar thistle, the reaper’s
scythe, the mourner’s veil, the dully sheening
Morrcoin and the flickering corpse candle,
to name a few. These images are rife with
meaning and magical potential, and many
superstitions revolve around them. In Shyish,
the symbols of death take on even greater
significance, for they are powerful conduits of
amethyst magic.

Perhaps the most potent of all deathly symbols
is the hourglass. With its sands slipping from
one chamber to another,
the hourglass is
used to mark the passage of time, and is an
obvious reminder of mortality. The stream of
sand runs steadily, so that at a casual glance
its movement seems almost imperceptible,
yet gradually the sands drain. Strangely the
stream always seems to run most swiftly
towards the end. Those most knowledgeable
in necromancy often use the hourglass in
disturbing rites and rituals, often using its

THE RISE OF THE WRAITHS

During the necroquake of Shyish, Nagash witnessed the terror sown by the profusion of malignant
gheist hordes. Here was the perfect shock attack – a terrible psychological weapon to unleash into
the very heart of his mortal foes.

Although the Nighthaunt
attacks during the necroquake
had wreaked havoc, there was
much to be improved upon.
The assaults often dwindled,
targets of opportunity were
poorly chosen, and there had
been little or no coordination
between the different
phantasmal armies. In the
free city of the Phoenicium
the spectral hosts had all
but defeated the defending
garrison of Stormcast Eternals,
but then became sidetracked,
content to terrify the populace
rather than razing the city.
The Sylvaneth defending their
wooded fortress of Gnarlok
were conquered, but none of
the gheists sought to claim
the highly magical woadstone
that the children of Alarielle
guarded,
leaving it to fall

into the hands of Beastmen.
Two successive waves of
Nighthaunts washed over the
Stormcast defences guarding
Vandium, each nearly defeating
the foe, but had they attacked
as one the undead would have
easily triumphed. From the
Kharadron sky-port of Barak-
Zon to the hidden undersea
cities of the Idoneth Deepkin,
many places were ravaged by
the rampaging spirits, but there
was no concentrated effort to
finish off the mortals.

To address such shortcomings,
Nagash sought a commander,
a leader that would unite and
drive the Nighthaunts to not
just terrorise mortalkind, but
to devastate them, leaving the
shocked survivors ripe for
Nagash’s final crusade.

THE SEARCH FOR A
NEW MORTARCH

The Mortarchs are Nagash’s
top lieutenants – powerful
undead leaders that have been
granted a sliver of the Great
Necromancer’s power. Each
of the existing Mortarchs, of
which there were three, was
chosen for their unique skills.
Should Nagash need corruption
he would turn to Neferata,
Mortarch of Blood. If he
needed to make a gory example
of the foe, then he would call
upon Mannfred von Carstein,
Mortarch of Night. For the
most secretive missions and
empire-building, he favoured
Arkhan the Black, Mortarch
of Sacrament. All commanded
their own undead legions and
all wished to wield still more
power. Yet Nagash desired a


PAGEBREAK
13

new element, and also loyalty,
for of the Mortarchs only
Arkhan the Black was truly
content to serve.

The tale of how Nagash scoured
the underworlds for a new
subordinate is a long one, for
there are untold dominions
of the dead. From Stygxx, the
Land of Forgotten Gods, to
the hidden cold-fire plains of
Helstrom;
from the relic-filled
lands of Carstinia to Hallost,
Land of Dead Heroes, no
afterlife was left unsearched.
Nagash fixed his baleful gaze
upon many souls – champions
of unconquerable tribes,
tyrant-kings of long-forsaken
empires, matriarchs of
bloodthirsty sisterhoods. Yet
Nagash sought some quality
they did not possess.

It was not clever manipulation,
base cunning, or well-planned
militar y strategy that earned
the armies of the dead so
many triumphs during the
necroquake – it was shock and
terror. The most overwhelming
victories had been won through
the suddenness of their assaults
and the wave of fear that spread
before the invasions and hung
heavily over all lands through
which the spectral hosts
passed. Nagash was impressed
with the psychological effect of
the Nighthaunt armies upon
the fragile and superstitious
minds of mortals.

In truth, Nagash had forgotten
the notion of fear,
for it
had been ages since he had
felt its tremble. Despite his
supreme intellect, the Great
Necromancer,
in his long plans,
had allowed his logical mind
to strategise without factoring
in the emotions of mortals. It
was a rare mistake, and one he
vowed not to repeat.

In all his travels across the
underworlds, Nagash found
none like the Veiled Lady. Here
was a spectre he had punished
many centuries ago with a
unique curse. In life she had

been Lady Olynder, a beauty
famed throughout the empire
of Dolorum – the largest of
civilisations from the lands
known since the Age of Chaos
as the Screaming Wastes. She
had schemed, plotted and used
charm to climb socially,
leaving
behind a trail of ruined suitors
and deaths under mysterious
circumstances. So great was her
appeal that she wound her way
upwards, winning the hearts
of nobles and then, eventually,
the Dolorum prince himself.
Her betrothal to the future king
ended on the very night when
the prince and his father,
the
high king, disappeared. In their
absence, she became the ruler
of Dolorum.

Vowing to mourn her missing
prince and king, the young
queen took to wearing a
veil. Her people called her
the Mourning Bride or the
Unrequited Queen, and her
public display of grief won over
even the coldest of hearts. Yet
it was all a lie – her shows of
remorse were false, her sorrows
no more than a ruse. Hidden
behind her veil and deceitful
sobs, she could not help but
smile at her own cleverness.

Elsewhere in the realms the
travails of the Age of Chaos
had begun turning civilisations
into ruin, although Dolorum
had thus far been spared.
That came to an end when
the plague arrived. Soon the
queen’s
sorrows were for her
realm, but again, all her tears

were false. She was safe in her
palace, and her life a dream,
even as all those around her
died in the agonised throes of a
weeping pox.

Through it all Nagash had
watched the empire of
Dolorum, for its people had
always honoured him. Their
dedications had ended with the
crowning of the new queen.
Even when her lands, cities
and throne room were all but
empty of life, Lady Olynder felt
no real grief, and she attempted
to parley with the agents of
Nurgle. It was then that Nagash
claimed her soul as his own. So
did Olynder become the Veiled
Lady, a spectre burdened to feel
all the miseries of the Mortal
Realms and forced to haunt
the ruins of Dolorum. After
the passing of many centuries,
during which Nagash gave not
a single thought to her fate, the
god was surprised at what he
found when he discovered her
once more.

The Veiled Lady had again
risen to rule over old Dolorum,
although it had become a land
swarming with wraiths and
spectres. During the upheavals
of the necroquake, Olynder
subjugated the phantasmal
denizens that arose there,
drawing them closer with her
spreading aura of grief. So
haunted were the lands that any
living being that dared enter
them experienced true terror.
Yet rule of one underworld
could not satisfy her ambition,
and the Veiled Lady longed to
bring more nations – living
and dead alike – beneath
her dominion.

Here, at last, was the leader
that Nagash was looking for,
and so in dark ritual the Great
Necromancer granted Lady
Olynder a sliver of his own
divinity. He knighted her the
Mortarch of Grief, and tasked
his new lieutenant first with
uniting the Nighthaunts,
and then leading them as the
vanguard of his new crusade.

REIGN OF TERROR

Untold spirits were invigorated
during the necroquake,
blasted forth to wreak havoc
on a tide of amethyst magic.
Subsequent aftershocks sent out
further ripples of phantasmal
destruction. The spectral
armies spent themselves
haphazardly, breaking off into
splinters to terrorise many
mortals before ultimately
disbanding, returning to local
sites where there was a rich
deposit of death magic.

Yet
it was not long thereafter
that the spectres heard a
summoning, a siren call that
not even the strongest-willed
spirit could resist. This was
not the imperious summons of
Nagash or his harsh lieutenants
of old, but a new voice. It was
an unholy lamentation, a call
that was at once a soulful wail
that bemoaned the half-life
horrors of a wraith, but also a
promise of vengeance – a vow
of black-handed revenge upon
all who still
lived.

With all realms still suffused
with amethyst magic, the dead
stirred once more, though this
time not to attack, but to return
to Shyish.

At Nagashizzar,
it was Lady
Olynder who summoned the
Nighthaunts. She divided the
massed undead into armies and
appointed sub-commanders,
assigning a Knight of Shrouds
to lead each spectral host.
As was her wont, all this was
conducted in a morbidly
ceremonial fashion – in ghostly
processions. Not until the next
wave of aftershocks emanated
from the Shyish Nadir did Lady
Olynder unleash her newly
assembled forces.

Like the howling of an ill wind,
the spectral hosts advanced on
a hundred fronts. They would
strike first in Shyish, and then
move through Realmgates
to spread terror across the
other realms. The old empire
of Lyria was the first to feel
the wrath of Lady Olynder’s

new Nighthaunt processions.
Relentlessly they moved from
one target to the next.

A NEW WAY OF WAR

With sudden and terrible
swiftness the Nighthaunts
attacked. In many locations
the horizon turned an eerie
greenish-blue – an ominous
spectacle caused by the
oncoming wave of vengeful
spectres. Elsewhere they
dove down from night skies,
rose from ground mists,
or swept straight through
protective walls.

In Lyria, upon the Plains of
Narth, were sprawled the
armies of the eight-armed
Chaos warlord Thur. It was
beneath his iron fist that
several underworlds had been
ransacked, and countless souls
claimed for the Dark Gods.
Now they were encamped on
the plains, and only a week’s
march from the cairn-city
of Glymmsforge.


PAGEBREAK
15

In an attack characteristic of
dozens of others across Lyria
and hundreds more over
the expanse of Shyish, three
Nighthaunt processions turned
the campsite into a bloodbath.

Bypassing all pickets and
guardians, the Nighthaunts
emerged from below. Surprise
was complete, and in moments
all was bedlam as panicking
foes routed. A thousand
different melees erupted
between the bonfires as hordes
of chain-wrapped spectres rose
up to overrun hulking Dragon
Ogors. Frenzy met its own
as Gorechosen clashed with
scythe-armed wraiths, neither
side willing to take a step
backwards in their eagerness to
slaughter the other.

So devastating was the
Nighthaunts’ assault that the
battle was over in moments.
But the wraithhosts did not
haunt the battlefield. Instead,
they disappeared, already en
route to their next target.

Those foes who dared to stand
against the quick-strike attacks
led by the Mortarch of Grief
found themselves embroiled in
a rapidly moving campaign like
no other. They fought against
armies that did not need food
or rest and that left no physical
sign of their passage,
leaving
foes to speculate where or when
the wraiths might arise again.

Nighthaunt processions used
their ethereal nature to fu l l
advantage. Entire armies
rose out of the ground to
strike without warning, and
disappeared just as quickly.
In the rare instances when
their assaults did not work as
planned, their armies simply
melted away, sinking into the
earth or stepping into eerie
mists to disappear entirely.

The Nighthaunts’
targets found
themselves ground down,
worn out from fighting and
chasing phantoms who were
not beholden to the same

worldly limitations as they.
But worse than any physical
strain was the psychological
onslaught. Even the bravest
might tremble before the wail
of a Tomb Banshee, or startle
at the sudden appearance of
the spectres. But there was
something more.

Surging like a bow wave before
the Nighthaunt processions
came an overwhelming sense
of fear, dread and foreboding.
This was the effect of Lady
Olynder,
for misery flew about
her like wind around the eye
of a hurricane. As enemy
commanders sought to rally
their troops they found even
their most stalwart regiments
moving more slowly, crushed
under the oppressive weight of
their own hopelessness.

Many victories followed –
during the Siege of Morlaix,
Lady Olynder herself destroyed
the Lord-Celestant in
command of the Stormcast foe.
At the Third Battle of Traitor’s
Gulch, a procession under
Baron Morbosi secured the
Calcified Realmgate, and at the
Mausoleum Mountains a force
of Nighthaunts reclaimed their
underworld of old, driving off
the Sigmarite interlopers. But
not all battles were triumphs.

At Glymmsforge, the Anvils
of the Heldenhammer held
off the Nighthaunts long
enough to allow some of the
most hated Stormhosts to
once more escape the Great
Necromancer’s vengeance.
The final battle to reclaim all
of Lyria was fought at Ghrun.
There, Lord Thur summoned
the Bloodthirster Khazkhan,
leader of the Helfire Legion.

The Chaos forces broke Lady
Olynder’s Grimguard and
nearly succeeded in destroying
the Mortarch. Only the arrival
of Arkhan the Black and
Nagash himself turned the tide,
and saw the foe vanquished.

Although pleased with her
conquests, Nagash judged
Lady Olynder to be overly
headstrong. To censure his
newest Mortarch, Nagash
orchestrated another of his
cruel ironies. She who used
betrothal only to climb to
power was forced into marriage
with a would-be king who
was every bit as ambitious
as she. Nagash deemed the
indomitable spectre of Kurdoss
Valentian a suitable match. He
would provide brute force and
tactical advice to complement
Olynder’s supernatural might.
Yet Kurdoss would never rule.
It had been his all-consuming
ambition in life to command,
though now that he had finally
risen to sovereignty,
true
authority was forever denied
to him. Together they would
serve Nagash, aiding him in
ushering in a new age – the
Age of Undeath. The Soul Wars
had begun.

THE SOUL WARS

Nagash lays claim to
Shyish and every soul that
enters the underworlds –
an entitlement he believes
was agreed upon by the
gods of Sigmar’s Pantheon
long ago. Though some,
like the Chaos Gods,
challenge this claim
openly and are known
foes, those members of
the Great Alliance, along
with their followers, who
withhold souls from
this destiny are branded
traitors. And many have
been so denounced – from
Sigmar and his Stormcast
Eternals, to the aelven
races, the Sylvaneth and
more – and it is Nagash’s
plan to make them pay.

Shyish, the Realm of Death

SHYISH, THE REALM OF DEATH

Shyish is a realm of endings, where amethyst magic is strongest. Within the realm’s borders are
every underworld ever summoned into being by the beliefs of mortal cultures. At the centre of all
stands the great citadel of Nagashizzar, where the Supreme Lord of the Undead dwells.

Throughout the ages the
civilisations of the Mortal
Realms have each forged
mythical concepts of where the
spirit departs to after death.
All of these imagined afterlives
coalesce in Shyish, the Realm
of Death, shaped by common
ideologies and given form in
that realm by its abundance of
amethyst magic. Yet
the realm
is not solely the domain of the
dead, for in addition to the
many lands therein that are
utterly inimical to life, there
are those which are entirely
habitable by the living.

Shyish is a series of sprawling
landscapes and oceans with
a deep pit in the centre – the
Shyish Nadir. Much like a
whirlpool, this central vortex
draws in those things that are
near to it, though it operates
on not gravity, but amethyst
magic. Since the necroquake,
those underworlds that are
forsaken or forgotten by their
mortal believers, or have simply
run their course, are dragged
closer to the Nadir. There
they are swallowed, crushed

to ultimate nothingness, for
above all else Shyish is a realm
of endings. As civilisations
decline and disappear, as
empires crumble, eventually so
too do their underworlds.

Yet whether an underworld is
populated by the living, the
dead or both, all are haunted
places. Amethyst magic is
plentiful and veins of grave-
sand marble the lands. When
the mists rise it is said that
they can re-animate corpses
or lure those cursed souls that
have become Nighthaunts.
The underworlds themselves
are magnets for the eldritch
energies of ending, and they
shape many environments,
flora and fauna that would be
impossible elsewhere.

All of the living inhabitants
of Shyish – from feral tribes
to civilised city-folk – have
devised their own wards
against the restless dead. It is
often said that mortals from
Shyish are highly superstitious,
and this is true, for each sect
has developed their own

methods of warding off the
many revenants that prey upon
the living. For them this is
a simple necessity that must
be learned by any mortals
daring to live in a realm of
underworlds and afterlives.

‘Never have I seen such bleak

landscapes,

such forlorn vistas.

It

is a grim place for grim folk,

and for the dead,

for everywhere

there can be found spirits.’

- Anaximander,

car tographer of Azyrhe im

CONQUERED
BY CHAOS

During the Age of Chaos,
Shyish came under assault
by the Dark Gods and their
minions. Many of its lands were
overrun, both those settled by
mortals and areas populated
solely by spirits. Cities were
levelled, the greatest cairn-
monuments were cast down,
and the hungering Chaos
Gods devoured souls while
their armies planted foul icons
wherever they conquered.


PAGEBREAK
17

Even Nagash was beaten,
forced to retreat and recover.
For centuries he was trapped,
the armies of the Dark Gods
besieging the underworld he
had taken refuge in. Despite
their best efforts, the forces of
Chaos could not gain access to
Nagash’s
sanctuary,
for travel
between the underworlds
can be notoriously difficult
without a deep understanding
of necromancy.

THE DEAD RETURN

The Great Necromancer
was not destroyed, merely
biding his time. Whether by
happenstance or design, he
timed his return with Sigmar’s
reopening of Azyr and the
Stormcast Eternal assaults
upon the Mortal Realms.

With the coming of the so-
called Age of Sigmar, Nagash
and his Mortarchs launched
dozens of campaigns to drive
back the forces of the Chaos. In
the Prime Innerlands,
in places
like Charnelcourt and the isle
of Dhûmi, the undead rose up
and re-conquered their lands
entirely, cleansing them of the
threat of Chaos.

And then came the near
completion of Nagash’s great
plan, and the necroquake. This

cataclysmic event altered the
lands, changing the polarity
of the flow of death magic in
Shyish and stirring the undead
to new heights of activity across
all the Mortal Realms.

With the labour of millions
of undead, the great capital
of Nagashizzar was rebuilt so
that once more Nagash could
ascend his throne. Now fuelled
by the power of the Great Black
Pyramid, Shyish draws in all
souls so that none might escape
Nagash. Yet
the Nadir is so
incredibly rich in amethyst
magic that even Nagash can
not dwell there indefinitely.
It is a place of insanity as well
as death, and even the most
ancient of vampires and liches
feel the compacted nothingness
of pure endings crushing down
upon them in that deathscape
of changeless eternity. It is from
this epicentre of pulse-less
power that Nagash launches his
endless streams of invasions –
both to reclaim the rest of his
realm and outwards to punish
the Mortal Realms.

Despite the many victories
achieved by Nagash and his
Mortarchs in the Realm of
Death, the vile tendrils of
Chaos still run deep in a
great many places. Areas like
Gothizzar are still controlled

by Chaos, as are the grim
forests of Modrhavn and the
entirety of the Kraniad Isle.
Ossia is in a constant state
of desperate war, even as it is
slowly dragged towards the
Shyish Nadir. Some of the most
corrupted regions – like the
tainted Rictus Realmgate in
Grishlon or the Bone Gardens
of Omeghar – are held by
daemon legions.

WELLSPRINGS
OF TERROR

While all of Shyish is
suffused with dark energies,
and Nighthaunts can be
found in every underworld,
there are some sites of
unholy power notorious for
producing spiritual horrors.
The Wraithfjords,
to the
north of Carstinia, the city
of Muertzhan and the isle
of Honour’s End have each
produced scores of Nighthaunt
processions. The nation of
Vinculus is home to the single
largest Chainrasp horde to ever
haunt the Mortal Realms – in
life, its inhabitants rebelled
against the rule of Nagash, and
so he cursed each and every
one of them to be linked for
eternity by arcane shackles.
Yet wherever a spirit originally
hails from, all now rush to heed
the siren call of Lady Olynder.

CHRONICLES OF TERROR

CHRONICLES OF TERROR

To the ageless spectres of the Nighthaunts time is immaterial, its passing all but meaningless to
those that live a phantasmal existence of eternal ending. Here are chronicled the pivotal deeds of
the Nighthaunts throughout each of the major eras.

AGE OF MYTH

There is a great deal of
Nighthaunt activity during
these years, but entire armies
composed of Nighthaunts are
rare occurrences.

RULER OF THE DEAD

Early in this period, Nagash
claims rule over Shyish and
constructs his great citadel and
seat of power, Nagashizzar.
He charges his Mortarchs
with enacting his wi l l across
the realm.

THE TIME OF
NEW BEGINNINGS

During the alliance between
Sigmar and Nagash, dozens
of cities are founded across
Shyish. In some – such as
Gothizzar, Glymmsforge,
Mortistan and Sepulchtan –
their mortal citizens either
pledge themselves to Nagash
or sponsor a Cult of Death that
earns the Great Necromancer’s
favour. In others, such as
Shadespire or Hawthorne’s
End, their lack of proper
respect for Nagash spells their
ultimate doom. Such is the
nature of Shyish, for it is a
place of endings far more than
new beginnings.

AGE OF CHAOS

Occasional, small-scale
incursions into Shyish by the
followers of the Dark Gods give
way to full-fledged invasions.

SOULSTORM

At the Battle of Dirge Peak
the undead suffer great losses
and are unable to withstand
the massed onslaught of
Bloodletters led by the
Bloodthirster Khazkhan.
Khorne had ever coveted the
lands of fallen heroes in the
Realm of Death, and wished
to claim them as his own.

In desperation, Nagash rips
forth the souls of a thousand
mortal prisoners, using them
to fuel a great summoning.
In response, the spirits of
the entire underworld of
Nordyrie – a northerly section
of the Endless Boneyard in
Hallost – answer the call. In
life they were all once heroes,
but had put down their swords
claiming they would fight only
for a cause, never for pay. In
death, Nagash’s
curse had made
them ruthless mercenaries,
who would combat any foe if
their price in souls was met.
The ethereal host not only
halts the daemons’ advance,
but defeats them utterly. Only
Khazkhan escapes destruction.
The Nordyrie become the first
entirely Nighthaunt host to be
mustered for a specific purpose,
and their services are destined
be called upon many times.

FALL OF DOLORUM

Once the largest of Shyish’s
civilisations, the empire of
Dolorum falls during the Age
of Chaos. The last ruler of those
lands, Lady Olynder,
is cursed
upon her death by Nagash so
that her spectre feels all the
sorrows of the realms.

THE GREAT BETRAYALS

The members of Sigmar’s
Pantheon become increasingly
estranged and divided. Nagash
finds evidence that Sigmar is
withholding souls from the
underworlds. At the Battle of
Burning Skies the promised
undead aid does not arrive,
and Sigmar blames his ensuing
defeat upon Nagash, abruptly
ending their alliance. Even
amidst the multiple Chaos
invasions across all Mortal
Realms there are battles
between former allies, as
the forces of Order feud
amongst themselves.

CHAINWRAITHS

The Idoneth Deepkin of the
Mor’phann enclave raid all
along the borders of the Great
Quagmire. In their quest for
souls they enter the Vale of
Chains, accidentally releasing a
spectral host that was cursed by
Nagash to be tormented there
for eternity. Freed from their
bondage, the Chainwraiths
seek to ki l l the living, but also
take their revenge upon any
undead that serve Nagash.

THE FALSE KING

Kurdoss Valentian almost
succeeds in usurping the crown
of Khajhi, but his coup is short-
lived. Valentian’s
backstabbing
draws Nagash’s
ire, so that
upon his death the craven king
receives a powerful curse…

RUINATION

At the height of multiple
Chaos invasions, Nagash
attempts to counter-attack.
At the culmination of the
War of Bones he is defeated
by Archaon, and his physical
form is shattered. While
Nagash slowly reforms in the
safety of a hidden underworld,
the Chaos forces level cities,
desecrate cairns, and even sack
Nagashizzar. Amidst the ruins
are raised the dread symbols
of the Dark Gods. During this
time of Chaos supremacy, only
the Nighthaunts are effective
in fighting the minions of the
Ruinous Powers, for even the
Mortarchs have slunk into
hiding. Several Nighthaunt
forces grow in notoriety
during this time, including the
Glowing Host – a strangely
luminescent horde from the
Glittering Marsh boasting
no fewer than twelve Tomb
Banshees – and the embittered

AGE OF SIGMAR

Even as Sigmar unleashes his
Stormcast Eternals a resurgent
Nagash bursts forth from the
Starless Gates. He summons
a tempest of amethyst magic,
raising his legions and
launching hundreds of attacks
to drive off the Chaos invaders.

BATTLE OF OSSIA

Stormcast Eternals arrive
throughout Shyish, and the
battles in Ossia are particularly
fierce. As the undead rise up,
alliances are formed between
the two estranged factions.
The fighting wavers back and
forth, but with the arrival
of the Mortarchs the Chaos
strongholds are eventually cast
down. Nagash does not forgive
those of Ossia for allowing
themselves to be conquered.

THE RETURN OF ORDER

Spurred on by Sigmar and
his Stormcast Eternals, the
forces of Order seize many
pivotal Realmgates. It is not
long before these beachheads
are expanded into fortresses,
and then rapidly grow into
cities as free peoples flock to
burgeoning civilisations.

MALIGN PORTENTS

Deities and wizards skilled in
the arts of augery read malign
portents in the air. Nagash’s
long plan of domination is at
last detected and many armies
rush into Shyish to halt the
Great Necromancer.

NECROQUAKE

Employing assaults designed
to delay his enemies, Nagash
nearly succeeds in fending off
those who would invade Shyish
and wreck his plan. However,
skaven agents contaminate
the Great Black Pyramid. The
resulting necroquake sends
massive waves of necromantic
energies across the cosmos,
and leads to the creation of the
Shyish Nadir.

A QUEEN SHALL RISE

After a long search that
saw Nagash peer into every

underworld known to him,
the Great Necromancer selects
Lady Olynder and appoints her
as his Mortarch of Grief.

BATTLEFIELD SHYISH

Lady Olynder’s first task is to
begin the long task of driving
back the Chaos forces that
still dominate Shyish. Over
one hundred Nighthaunt
processions are hurled into
the fray, fighting alongside
Nagash’s
legions. Each of the
existing Mortarchs sees the
opportunity to take Lady
Olynder’s measure. Although
Mannfred von Carstein and
Neferata resent the newcomer’s
share of power, all of the
Mortarchs quickly realise she
is a formidable addition to
their ranks.

CLOUD RAIDERS

An enterprising sky-fleet of
Kharadron Overlords attempts
to build a base from which to
plunder the aether-gold that
drift high above Shyish. Their
ability to remain above the
clouds had kept them safe from
many foes – but not Baroness
Ravenblack and her Blackguard
procession. The duardin
are swept over by packs of
Dreadscythe Harridans.
One by one, the guns of the
Kharadron fall silent, and their
ships plummet from the sky.

BRIEF ALLIANCE

In many places the newly
anointed Nighthaunt
processions join forces with
Flesh-eater Courts in order to
destroy Chaos invaders. Such
alliances are of convenience
only. At the Battles of Lake
Lethis, the Grymfens, and
throughout the campaign of
Ossia the tale was the same
– after the common foe was
defeated the spectral hosts
turned upon the vile cannibals
and destroyed them also.

THE BRIAR QUEEN

The Briar Queen – nemesis of
the cursed city of Shadespire
– is unleashed by Nagash to
menace other lands. She is

tasked with claiming certain
souls that have cheated Nagash.
With the aid of her spectral
army – the Thorns of the
Briar Queen – she visits each
of the Mortal Realms, always
bringing back her target’s
soul.
Between missions the Briar
Queen returns to Shadespire,
for her need for vengeance
there remains unsatisfied.

NEAR DISASTER
AT GHRUN

The last battle to cleanse
Lyria of Chaos is almost Lady
Olynder’s undoing. Although
victorious in the end, her
near destruction at the hands
of a Bloodthirster draws
censure from Nagash, who
both punishes and rewards
his new Mortarch with her
betrothal to the Craven King,
Kurdoss Valentian.

THE SOUL WARS

Nagash deems it is time to
launch his long-planned
crusade to reclaim all those
souls he sees as rightfully
his – that is, all souls that
ever were. Strikes are levelled
against the factions that
have betrayed Nagash by
withholding the spirit-stuff of
their dead – the followers of
Chaos, the Stormcast Eternals,
the Idoneth Deepkin, the
aelves of Hysh, the Sylvaneth
and the Daughters of Khaine
among them. The first wave is
conducted by the Nighthaunt
processions. Thus, even in
the wake of the necroquake, a
further tide of undead attacks
sweeps across the Mortal
Realms. Led by the Mortarch
of Grief, every major free city
is assailed. The Nighthaunts
prove themselves beyond doubt
to be the tip of Nagash’s
spear
of terror.

THE GRIMHAILER

During the Nighthaunt attacks,
none are more active than
Reikenor. Time after time, the
Grimhailer uses the shock of
his spectral assaults to crush
his enemies utterly, claiming
many souls for Nagash.

GHOSTLY PROCESSIONS

GHOSTLY PROCESSIONS

For battle, the spectral hosts of wraith creatures are organised by order of Nagash. Beneath the
overall command of Lady Olynder, the Mortarch of Grief, the Nighthaunt processions are sent
forth to wreak havoc as the vanguard of the Great Necromancer’s deathly forces.

Nighthaunts have always been
wayward spirits, prone to
following their own thirst for
revenge. Only when ensnared
by a more powerful being –
such as Nagash, a Mortarch,
Soulblight vampire or
Necromancer – do the ethereal
creatures submit to following
another’s lead. But now, even
the most isolated have been
enthralled to Lady Olynder,
Mortarch of Grief.

the

At her summons the spectres
muster, answering a siren
call that promises vengeance
against the living. Lady
Olynder organises the massed
phantasmal hordes, breaking
them down into hard-striking
and distinct armies.

On the most vital campaigns,
Lady Olynder leads her own
Nighthaunt procession, often
accompanied by her spectral
consort, Kurdoss Valentian.
More frequently, however, a
procession is commanded by
a Knight of Shrouds. There are
notable exceptions, as powerful
spirits are sometimes given
generalship over a wraith host.
Infamous examples of such
individuals are Reikenor the
Grimhailer and the Cairnking
Angrimm, both of whom are
often known to command their
own armies. Although Kurdoss
Valentian is sometimes sent
on missions away from Lady
Olynder’s side, he is never
the commander – another of
Nagash’s
cruel ironies.

A Nighthaunt procession
draws much of its character
from its commander. For
instance, the most rage-filled
or bloody-handed of generals
invigorate their minions and
charge forward in quick-strike
fashion. More gloom-ridden
doombringers prefer to pin the
foe in place, eroding their wi l l
with waves of desolation before
hurling in elite reserve forces to
finally break the enemy.

Beneath a procession’s
commander are any number
of captains – Dreadblade
Harrows, Spirit Torments,
Cairn Wraiths, Lord
Executioners, Tomb Banshees
and Guardians of Souls. These
potent spirits are used to lead

assaults or to unleash potent
attacks upon the foe. A few
such spectres have achieved
notoriety, such as the Briar
Queen of Shadespire, and
the Knight of Shrouds Sir
Morwyrt Blackheart, who is
always accompanied by a trio
of Lord Executioners. Some
commanders use their captains
as bodyguards, while others
prefer a Shroudguard – a circle
of Bladegheist Revenants
bound by magical oaths to
protect their liege at all costs.

The bulk of most Nighthaunt
processions are drawn from
the ethereal rank and file – less
powerful but more numerous
spirits like Chainrasps and
Glaivewraith Stalkers. These
are grouped together and
are typically led by one of
the wraith captains. Such
formations have different
strengths, and are usually
deployed with specific purposes
in mind by their commanders.

A Chainguard comprises large
numbers of Chainrasps under
the control of a Guardian
of Souls. These hosts are
often used as the centre of a
Nighthaunt battleline, or for
holding up powerful enemies.
Even as the Chainrasps are
destroyed, the Guardian of
Souls uses its magic to reform
them, creating an anvil upon
which many foes break. Other
groupings of Nighthaunts
include the Death Stalkers –
hunting forces tasked with
seeking out and destroying
particular enemies – and the
Condemned – Chainrasps
and Chainghasts driven
mercilessly into the enemy by
a Spirit Torment. Such ragged
multitudes are less concerned
with holding up the foe, more
with slaying them.

Other Nighthaunt
formations
are fewer in number but made
up of more powerful spirits.
The Shrieker Host is such a
gathering. Led by a Tomb
Banshee, it is composed of
Dreadscythe Harridans and

Myrmourn Banshees. Ideally,
such a force drifts towards the
battlefront while the enemy
is engaged. Just as the Tomb
Banshee unleashes her hellish
shriek, the Dreadscythe
Harridans sweep in to unleash
their fury. The Myrmourn
Banshees devour enemy spells
while adding their own chill
daggers to the fray. Few foes
survive the charge of a Shrieker
Host, but those that do soon
find their wi l l to fight failing
beneath its horrible cacophony.

When spectral cavalr y ride to
battle alongside a Black Coach,
they are collectively known
as Deathriders. These fast-
moving contingents are ideal
for smashing apart the flanks
of the enemy army and for
launching sudden attacks. An
Execution Horde, meanwhile,
concentrates a great deal of
power into a compact force. Its
constituent Spirit Hosts and
the Lord Executioner that leads
them are able to manoeuvre
between larger formations
before closing in to deliver the
ki l ling blow.

As per Nagash’s
command,
Lady Olynder sends forth her
processions as quickly as she
forms them. Those that meet
with success are given new
tasks by the Mortarch, while
those that fail are summoned
back to Nagashizzar. There,
the merciless Lady Olynder
breaks the spectral host apart
and reassigns its various
spirits to different armies,
resulting in a variety of
compositions between the
processions. Some remain
homogeneous, for they are
formed from spirits gathered
from the same locale, like the
hoarfrost-covered wraiths
from Helspoint that glow
with a cold light, or the Blood
Mavens – a force dominated by
Dreadscythe Harridans known
for their crimson locks. Other
processions are more disparate,
each battalion or unit drawn
from different underworlds, or
even from other realms.

Under the rule of Lady
Olynder, and driven by her
fierce demand for victory,
many processions have already
garnered a fell reputation. The
strangely lambent Glowing
Host from the Glittering
Marsh field an inordinate
number of Tomb Banshees,
and have proved unstoppable
in their many attacks upon the
Chaos forces in Shyish. The
vast Chainguard host from
the fallen lands of Viniculum
do not simply defeat enemy
armies, they overrun entire
populations. The Reaverhost
hail from martial stock, for
they come from the underworld
reserved for the finest knights
of old Dolorum. It is said when
the moonlight strikes them
at the right angle, a pale and
ghostly hint of the livery they
wore in life can still be seen.

S ana knew the end
was near. Every
rasping breath she
drew pained her. As the
village healer, she had
done all she could with
her knowledge of herbs
to ease the agony of her
passing. Now, there was
nothing to do but wait.
And Sana was ready – she
had outlived her husband
and her frail form no
longer worked as it used
to. She hoped to soon be
reunited with her love,
for such was the belief
of her people – that the
worthy would be gifted an
afterlife with other goodly
souls. She knew nothing
about Nagash’s
curse on
healers. When next she
opened her eyes all the
warmth of the world was
gone. She now floated like
mist, her hands replaced
with reaping scy thes. In
a dreamlike state Sana
watched her new, horrible
form commit the worst
atrocities, a rage beyond
her control driving her to
attack all that still lived.

Lady Olynder,
Mortarch of Grief

LADY OLYNDER, MORTARCH OF GRIEF

Nagash sought everywhere for a commander to lead his newly risen Nighthaunts, and found none more terrible
than Lady Olynder of Dolorum. As the newly appointed Mortarch of Grief, it is she that rules the spiritual hosts
that seek to establish a reign of terror across the Mortal Realms.

She is the Mourning Bride, the
Unrequited Queen, the Veiled Lady
and the Mortarch of Grief. She is
despair made manifest, gloom given
form. She is Lady Olynder, and in
her are bound all the sorrows and
anguishes of the realms.

Each of Nagash’s Mortarchs has been
anointed with a portion of the Great
Necromancer’s vast power. To Lady
Olynder, who feigned sorrow in life,
he gifted a mantle of misery – she
now felt all the woes of the Mortal
Realms, becoming a weaponisation
of grief itself. Her power transcends
the melancholic, for she exudes
mind-crippling waves of purest
desolation. Mortals in her presence
are overwhelmed by a gloom so
heavy that only the strongest willed
can remain upright. Most fall to
their knees, mentally battered by
their own utter hopelessness. It is a
sorrow and regret potent enough to
cause a mother to forsake her child,
a warrior to lay down his sword
and accept the inevitable, to stop a
beating heart.

Lady Olynder hovers above
the ground, attended by her
bridesmaids, a pair of banshee
handmaidens. As she advances,
the thorny vines of grave-roses
instantaneously sprout before her,
their flowers rapidly blooming and
dying in order to lay a path of fallen
petals beneath her floating form. In
her hands the Veiled Lady wields the
Staff of Midnight, an ornate stave
topped with a polished gemstone
of vitrified grave-sand. The lightest
touch of this staff is enough to wither
a mighty oak, or ki l l a grown man
outright. Yet
it is not Lady Olynder’s
deadliest weapon.

In addition to being surrounded
by an aura of absolute misery, Lady
Olynder is also a powerful sorceress.
With her incantations, she can direct
a pall of despair to weigh upon her
foes, slowing them like some unholy
lodestone. Those afflicted suffer a

mental burden so dire it causes even
the bravest to tremble, their martial
prowess lessened by leaden limbs
and despondency beyond any hope
of redemption.

In the midst of this bleak atmosphere
she has created, Olynder presses
forward, her banshee bridesmaids
shrieking a wail of the damned while
slashing with spectral talons at foes
who draw close. One bridesmaid
bears an ensorcelled grave-sand
hourglass – a gift from Nagash – that
can be smashed asunder with lethal
effect. Yet Lady Olynder has another,
even deadlier weapon. From behind
her thin shroud, the sunken eyes of

the Mortarch of Grief fixate upon a
foe. Deliberately she pivots to face
them, before slowly and solemnly
lifting her veil. What horrors they
see are unknown, for none have yet
lived to tell the tale. So does Lady
Olynder conquer,
leading the fore of
Nagash’s
invasion in order to bring
a new age of eternal death over the
Mortal Realms.

‘Do not resist – death is inevitable. The

more quickly you succumb,

the sooner

your suffering will be over. Come to

me, and be mine for evermore…’

- Lady Olynder

Kurdoss Valentian, the Craven King

KURDOSS VALENTIAN, THE CRAVEN KING

The dire presence of Kurdoss Valentian is announced by dirgeful trumpets and grim proclamations of his basest
deeds. The Craven King sits silent and motionless upon his drifting throne until he closes with the enemy, and
then he wields the Sepulchral Sceptre to deadly effect, mercilessly slaying all whom his queen bids.

23

Kurdoss utters not a word as he
hovers upon his throne. Only when
he wishes to smite the foe does he
deign to move from his despondent
posture. The same cannot be said for
his spectral attendants. These are the
spirits of two who Kurdoss betrayed
and supplanted as part of his bloody
path to commandeer rule. Now
the heralds are fated to serve him
eternally and announce his many
triumphs. However,
they take cruel
glee in declaring his defamatory
titles – the Usurper, False Lord and
Craven King – and interjecting with
boasts of the many ignoble deeds
that marked his quest for power.

Once forceful and commanding,
Kurdoss Valentian’s
curse prevents
him from speaking in anything
more than a whisper – gone are his
days of booming orders and taking
charge. When prudent, he issues
tactical advice garnered from his
many victories upon the field of
battle, but when he attempts to say
more, nothing but the dust of ages
issues from his mouth. An aura of
bitterness exudes from Kurdoss so
powerful that it can choke enemy
captains and generals even as they
seek to issue their own orders, the
words foundering and dying upon
their trembling lips.

Nagash needed an appropriate
lieutenant to serve his newly
crowned Mortarch of Grief. Kurdoss
Valentian proved an especially fitting
choice – the king provided Lady
Olynder with a fearsome bodyguard
and a tactically minded advisor,
and their cold betrothal was cruelly
pleasing to Nagash.

In life Kurdoss had a ruthless desire
to rule, and many were his wicked
deeds to claim power,
including the
assassination of allies, the betrayal of
entire armies and the murder of his
own brothers. Just as Kurdoss took
up the fallen crown of his last sibling,
Nagash claimed his soul. Unlike his
brothers, Kurdoss did not worship
Nagash, but instead had chosen the
God-King Sigmar as his patron –
reason enough to draw the Great
Necromancer’s
ire.

Even as a wraith in the spirit world
Kurdoss’ relentless ambition saw
him rise. Nagash was impressed with
the Craven King’s resourcefulness
and fighting skill, yet it was not
his desire to see Kurdoss claim
rule over an underworld nation.
The Great Necromancer whisked
Kurdoss away from the afterlife
kingdom he was usurping for his
own, instead granting him a touch
from Alakanash, the Staff of Power.
In doing so, Nagash bestowed upon
Kurdoss great might, yet also an
accompanying curse.

Nagash ensured that Kurdoss’
ultimate dream of rule was realised
in name only,
for he was betrothed
to Lady Olynder,
fated to always
follow her lead. Indeed, Kurdoss
became little more than a strongman
– a bitter jest to be so close to all he
desired, yet still so far away.

Kurdoss bears several symbols of his
new office, including the throne he
aspired to sit in life. He also carries
the Sepulchral Sceptre – a weapon
that in Kurdoss’ hands can split rock
or crack open a gargant’s
skull.

Reikenor the
Grimhailer

24

REIKENOR THE GRIMHAILER

Once a sorcerer-king rich in the knowledge of amethyst magic, Reikenor ran afoul of Nagash. Now,
in undeath,
the Grimhailer is cursed to serve the Great Necromancer, acting as his chief reaper of souls. There are few sights
more ominous than the macabre wraith-wizard atop his winged steed, lit by the eerie light of his corpse candles.

In Shyish, Reikenor is known by
many names – the Grimhailer,
the
Reaper-wraith and the Storm Rider
among them. Sorcerer, master of
terror, reaper of souls, fell lieutenant
of Nagash – Reikenor is all these
things and more.

Much of Reikenor’s origins are
mysterious,
lost to time, but what
is known is that he was once a
learned sorcerer-king who sought to
overcome death. Through the magic
of Hysh – harnessing the very light
of reason – Reikenor worked towards
preventing all mortality. His quest
for knowledge on the subject was all-
consuming, and he attracted many
acolytes and followers. Eventually
Reikenor’s attempts to unbind the
workings of death drew the ire of
Nagash himself.

In the afterlife the Grimhailer
still hunts, but now he does so in
the name of Nagash. His quarr y
is no longer eldritch secrets of
mortality – instead he seeks those
who transgress against his master.
Through his arcane powers Reikenor
can sense those that withhold
souls from Nagash, tamper with
his necromantic rituals, desecrate
his monuments or commit any
other sacrilegious act. Those who
are not in service to Nagash but
pursue necromantic knowledge are
especially targeted.

Upon detecting blasphemies,
Reikenor swoops down upon his
winged steed shrieking the syllables
of powerful hexes whilst dealing
sweeping blows with his scythe,
Fellreaper. However, even those
Reikenor slays in battle he is not

finished with – for such unfortunates
he has further torments in store.

Through his incantations, Reikenor
can summon a wraithstorm – a
cyclone of amethyst magic that stirs
those souls recently separated from
their bodies. Inspired by Nagash’s
desire to see grim justice meted out
upon those that offer him insult or
rebel against his wishes, Reikenor’s
spell incites the departed spirits
to savagely attack their former
comrades. The spell creates a spectral
hurricane in which wraith-like
phantoms hack and pull down the
living. Thus is a dark vengeance
delivered to those that would
thwart Nagash.

To aid Reikenor in his appointed
task, Nagash has bound to him
Kyllaron, a fierce winged Nightmare.
Mounted on the undead steed’s head
armour are a grim assortment of
corpse candles. They are a unique
mix of tallow rendered from
Reikenor’s former apprentices along
with a grave-sand mix. Indeed, after
his soul was claimed by Nagash,
it
was the Grimhailer’s own disciples
that were his first target. They too
were blasphemers and Nagash
deemed their fate fitting. By snuffing
out the flame of a corpse candle,
Reikenor can end the life of a nearby
mortal or siphon off a portion of his
own essence – either way, by doing
so he creates a surge of arcane force
to empower his enchantments. The
Grimhailer is now condemned to ki l l
forever, and that he must extinguish
light and create darkness to do so is a
cruel twist that Nagash holds as one
of his most just punishments.

Prior to the Shyish necroquake,
Reikenor often hunted the Mortal
Realms on his own. Following the
rise of Lady Olynder,
the wraith-
wizard has joined the Nighthaunts,
leading processions on her behalf
or following missions set by the
Mortarch of Grief. So is his power
greater than ever before.

Knights of Shrouds

KNIGHTS OF SHROUDS

Born of tragedy and betrayal, Knights of Shrouds are spectral commanders blessed with unholy power by Nagash
himself. They are the leaders of the Nighthaunt armies, the directing minds behind the processions of horrors that
serve the Great Necromancer. Where these fell generals lead, terror soon follows.

25

that steals the soul energy of those it
slays, transferring a portion of that
power back into its wielder. As they
did before their spectral existence,
some Knights of Shrouds ride to
battle upon ethereal steeds, while
others prefer to fight on foot. All are
formidable bladesmen – fell-handed
foes with many lifetimes’ worth of
battle experience.

It is not solely for their martial
prowess that Knights of Shrouds
are appointed as Nighthaunt
commanders, however. These were
leaders of soldiers, canny generals
that understood the arts of war. Now,
their chill, disembodied voices ring
out over the battlefield, directing
their forces and instilling them
with a fierce vigour not seen in the
unliving hosts of the Deathrattle and
Deadwalkers. While the Nighthaunts
automatically heed a Knight of
Shrouds’ orders, the living consider
these dire figures to be the worst
kind of traitors imaginable.

DREADBLADE HARROWS

The Dreadblade Harrows are the
officers beneath the Knights of
Shrouds. In life, each of these wights
watched their leader’s betrayal,
neither helping nor hindering.
Their half measures have been duly
rewarded with a curse in death, for
they are compelled to serve their
treacherous lords eternally.

Even for Nighthaunts, Dreadblade
Harrows are especially discorporate,
phantasmal figures atop spectral
steeds, who can disappear and
reappear at will. They are the
Knights of Regret, fu l l of bitter
recriminations. In battle they serve
as bodyguards and lieutenants, or
are despatched as outriders. Rearing
upon their spectral steeds, they
vanish into wisps of mist only to
gallop out of thin air elsewhere to
fulfil even the most unchivalrous
commands – culling the vulnerable,
cutting off retreating warriors, and
other heinous tasks.

In life, Knights of Shrouds were
militar y commanders – great
leaders of men that bartered their
souls away to Nagash. In return,
these spirits have been granted
power and immortality, becoming
generals in command of the
Nighthaunt processions.

The making of a Knight of Shrouds
does not occur at random, for
Nagash does nothing on impulse.
Since the Age of Myth the greatest
champions of mankind were
targeted, and whether they led
unruly hordes or disciplined armies
fu l l of pomp and pageantry, undead
hosts were thrown against them.
Some of those warrior-exemplars
died in combat, others rallied their
troops in order to stave off disaster.
However,
time and numbers have
always been on the side of the dead,
for Nagash is immortal, and his
armies legion.

Over time, no few of the opposing
leaders were ground down. Only
those that were willing to betray
their own people and pledge an
oath to Nagash were spared. These
traitors were granted immortality,
transformed into spectral generals.
Many have been held long in hidden
underworlds, yet only now has
Nagash unleashed them to lead his
Nighthaunt processions.

Even the most cold-hearted Knight
of Shrouds suffers some degree of
anguish over their betrayal, and
in order to forget their past each
plunges headlong into their duties
and the blackness of undeath. Each
tells themselves they had no choice,
that anyone else would have done the
same in their position, but a worm of
doubt forever gnaws at what is left of
their soul. They are cursed to forever
carr y their misdeeds, and also to
bring death to the living.

Upon forfeiting their life to Nagash,
a Knight of Shrouds is gifted a Sword
of Stolen Hours – a cursed blade

Spirit Torments &
Chainghasts

26

SPIRIT TORMENTS & CHAINGHASTS

Immortal and vindictive, Nagash created Spirit Torments and Chainghasts to capture and watch over unrepentant
offenders and – perhaps most importantly of all – to persecute them. Here are the gaolers of Shyish, the Keepers of
the Keys and the fell guardians of the underworlds.

SPIRIT TORMENTS

The Spirit Torments are the lords
of the Great Oubliette of Shyish, a
continent-sized underworld of dank
cells and ice-cold dungeons. Known
as shacklegheists to the elders of the
Shyish Innerlands, they were once a
rare sight in the Mortal Realms, but
following the eruption of fell magic
during the necroquake they have
become far more common. Since the
launching of the great processions
the Spirit Torments have regularly
joined the Nighthaunt
forces.

Spirit Torments are entrusted with
a duty Nagash considers vitally
important, for it is their role to
capture the souls of transgressors –
in particular those that Nagash sees
as having escaped their due fate. For
this reason, Nighthaunt processions
that are tasked with the hunting and
capture of specific souls are always
joined by Spirit Torments.

A Spirit Torment draws its victim’s
soul into its shacklegheist chains –
heavy bonds forged of malefic iron
and tempered by fell ritual. This
chill metal acts as an enchanted jail,
trammelling the life-force as soon
as the attached lock closes tight.
The spiritual energies cannot escape
until the padlock is re-opened, an
act that is typically done upon the
procession’s
return to its haunting
grounds in Shyish. There, the
heavy arcane vessels are unlocked,
delivering their contents into the
clutches of a gaoler king, or perhaps
a Mortarch.

The fate of a Torment-apprehended
spirit depends upon the strength
of the soul and the crimes that it
committed in its mortal life. The
majority are remade into lesser
Nighthaunts, but some are instead
trapped in a pocket of unreality
linked to the Great Oubliette. A very
few are instead reserved for some
exquisite misery dreamed up by the
ever-vengeful Mortarchs, or even
Nagash himself.

While a Spirit Torment can collect
any drifting soul that has been
recently severed from its physical
body, the cruel nature of the spectral
gaolers means that they far prefer
to be the agent of the separation
themselves. With a groaning effort
the Spirit Torment hoists up the
jangling chains and begins to swing
them. The heavy,
lock-capped links
whirl with impressive momentum,
and should one connect, it wi l l stave
in a ribcage or a skull as easily as a
direct hit from a cannonball.

Spirit Torments take pleasure in
their dark work, though as much
as they delight in ending lives and
capturing souls, there is one aspect
of their duties they enjoy above all
others. The spiteful phantoms can
peer into their padlocked prisons,
gazing over the bright soul-stuff
captured within. Then, they draw a
great breath with a discordant howl,
a chilling inhalation that steals hope,
robbing the imprisoned spirits of
energy even as it subjects them to
nightmarish angst and dread.

Filled with the energies of the
incarcerated souls, the Spirit
Torments exude an aura of
malevolence and despair. At times
this malignant force can even be seen
as pale, greenish wisps of spiritual
radiance amongst which faces leer,
taloned hands reach out to grasp,
and agonised screams echo. To the
living these emanations evoke purest
terror, and are oppressive even to
those who cannot see. To bask in
such baleful phenomena is to be
overcome with feelings of morbidity
and gloom. To other Nighthaunts
these harrowing energies are
invigorating, driving the wraith-
creatures on towards still greater acts
of violence and spite.

There are many Spirit Torments,
but some have earned great infamy.
Karceris the Black-hearted was the
gaoler of the Gristlespine tribes
during the Chaos conquest of

Morthaven. His misdeeds became
legend, but near his end Karceris
disavowed his past, attempting to
cleanse his soul with penitent acts. It
was not enough, and Nagash claimed
him, naming him the phantasmal
overseer of the Cryptopolis –
the largest of the dungeons of
Nagashizzar. Other Spirit Torments,
such as Mawcrasp of Malendrek’s
procession or the Rusthaunt of the
Crimson Procession, have earned
their fell notoriety for the sheer
number of souls they have returned
to the great mausoleums of Nagash.

The Spirit Torments have been more
active and seen further abroad
since the coming of the Shyish
Nadir, but they are rarely seen
alone. They are accompanied by
wraith-like enforcers and lackeys,
the most common of which are the
manacle-laden Chainghasts.

TO CAGE LIGHTNING

There are some – from Shyishan
scholars to the astromancers of
Azyrheim – who believe there
is a correlation between the
appearance of Spirit Torments
and the Stormcast Eternals.
Whether sheer coincidence,
or symptomatic of cunningly
laid traps, the appearance
of Sigmar’s Stormhosts –
especially in Shyish, but
also in other realms – draws
an inordinate number of
Nighthaunt processions
containing one or more Spirit
Torments. On battlefields
where the two sides meet in
open warfare, there have been
multiple sightings of the soul-
capturing wraiths using the
power of their shacklegheist
chains to prevent the typical
return to the heavens of the
slain Stormcasts. Surely, Nagash
seeks to reclaim souls he sees as
rightfully belonging to him.

CHAINGHASTS

Chained captives awaiting a terrible
doom are wont to plead, beg and call
out for divine aid. However, Nagash
is a god without the slightest hint of
mercy. To the Great Necromancer
it matters not whether those
iron-bound prisoners are guilty or
innocent, or if their ends came swift
or were cruelly prolonged. He cares
only that their lives ended, for upon
death all mortal souls are his due.
However,
those condemned that
called out for godly intervention
but did not include Nagash in their
supplications are noted, and grim
plans are made for the ultimate fate
of those unfortunate souls.

Upon their deaths, the spirit-essence
of those that die in captivity but do
entreat upon the Lord of Undeath
are made into Chainghasts. Infinitely
spiteful, the Great Necromancer
deems it fitting to keep such souls

eternally imprisoned. Each of these
wraith-spirits is encased within an
armoured harness further bound
with enchanted iron padlocks.

To burden Chainghasts further,
Nagash has ordained that each spirit
must be tethered to weights bound to
heavy chains wrought of black-iron.
This cursed metal is alloyed with
dreadful emotions – the worst pangs
of fear and hopelessness experienced
by those callously enslaved. These
‘ghastflails’ are the weapons with
which Chainghasts reap new souls,
swinging them in great arcs to
bludgeon a bloody path through the
foe. When whirled with sufficient
force the ghastflails build up a deadly
charge of purest misery. Used like
a massive sling, a ghastflail can
launch this pent-up energy, hurling
corrosive bolts of spirit force that eat
straight through armour to burn a
target’s
soul.

Chainghasts exist only to serve
the Spirit Torment named their
master. It is their duty to slay whom
he commands, whether in close
quarters battle or at range. Thus are
the chain-bound spirits sent out
to wreak havoc, battering mortal
bodies to create a rich harvest of
souls to be incarcerated into the
arcane jails of the Spirit Torments.

Behind sealed iron masks the
Chainghasts’ minds retain dim
memories of their mortal past. Like
some dream half forgotten upon
waking, each spirit maintains an
inexplicable yearning to be free, an
urge to escape from bondage, yet
it is a desire upon which they can
never act. Chainghasts are bound to
automatically obey each and every
command of their Spirit Torment.
Trapped in a never-ending mind-
loop, even their innermost thoughts
are but another prison.

Wraith Captains

28

WRAITH CAPTAINS

Dotted across a Nighthaunt procession are various spectral sub-commanders and champions. As befits the
macabre nature of the ghastly hosts, these individuals are not formal militar y officers, but rather greater spirits –
fell spectres imbued by Nagash with even more formidable powers and malignancy.

GUARDIANS OF SOULS

Each Guardian of Souls is a nexus
of undead energy. Once, they were
lesser Necromancers that used
amethyst magic to further their own
cause, yet their arcane knowledge
was not enough to keep them alive.
Nagash eventually claimed their
souls, shaping them to better fit his
needs. Now they use their spells not
for their own ends, but to summon
more Nighthaunts or restore spirits
damaged in battle.

In addition to a deadly chill blade
or heavy maul of judgement,
Guardians of Souls bear either a
nightmare lantern or a mortality
glass. A nightmare lantern is a
ghostly beacon lit by the Flame of
Nagashizzar. The mind-chilling
smoke they exude does not rise up to
the heavens, but instead drifts down
towards the field of battle. Nearby
Nighthaunts are invigorated by the

wafting vapours, and a Guardian
of Souls can channel the lantern so
that the cold fingers of smoke snake
through the earth, beckoning spirits
to rise out of their graves or chilling
mortal foes to death. A Guardian
with a mortality glass can slow time,
making oncoming enemies feel
as if trapped in a nightmare. The
arcane spectre can also use sorcery
to distort the hourglass, allowing
nearby Nighthaunts to move with
terrifying swiftness.

LORD EXECUTIONERS

In the living world executioners are
tasked with the ending of life, often
by axe stroke or noose. Those that
knowingly slay the innocent as well
as the guilty – claiming that they
are ‘just doing their duty’ – attract
the gaze of Nagash. The same is true
for those that enjoy their work too
much, even those that seek to repent.

In death – especially those slain by
the relatives of the innocents they
slaughtered – these headsmen are
remade into the spectral form of a
Lord Executioner. They are charged
by Nagash to slay heroes, champions,
kings and anyone that defies his laws.

Lord Executioners each bear a
massive decapitating axe, and
some carr y the phantasmal echoes
of accoutrements from their past,
such as a gallows, torture wheel or
stretching rack. The spectres are also
surrounded by skull-faces wreathed
in balefire. These visages are the
remaining spirits of innocents
the executioner slew in life. They
harass their killer, haranguing him
constantly, but also warding him
against dangers, blocking enemy
spells and sword blows. They do
this not as a kindness, but so he
can never escape the executioner’s
bloodthirsty work.

CAIRN WRAITHS

The souls of only the most sick and
twisted mortals descend into the
underworlds and become Cairn
Wraiths. Most spirits simply devolve,
turning into shades that are mere
echoes of their former selves, dark
fodder for Nagash’s
fell purposes.
Some, however, remain defiant.
Those with supreme willpower to
endure the spiritual torments that
strip away all that they were save
their unending hatred. Only the
most spiteful of mass murderers
endure, and they become Cairn
Wraiths – spectres that delight in
hacking down mortals to watch their
souls seep outwards.

Armed with a reaper scythe, Cairn
Wraiths of the past were lone
predators that haunted sites where
amethyst magic lay heavy, such
as battlefields, barrows or areas
where some great tragedy occurred.
Soulblight vampires sought out
these killers and used magic to bind
their services, for Cairn Wraiths
serve no other willingly. After the
floods of death magic unleashed by
the Shyish necroquake, the hooded

ghasts stalked the Mortal Realms in
numbers never before seen. With a
single act – the ritualistic building
of the Great Cairnoch – Nagash
bound them all instantly. Some
Cairn Wraiths were shackled into
the service of Necromancers, or
vampires, but most drifted into
Nighthaunt processions, where
Knights of Shrouds made quick use
of their fearsome combat prowess
and eagerness to deal death.

TOMB BANSHEES

Those most betrayed or tormented
in life find no succour in death, for
they are drawn to an afterlife devoid
of rest, filled only with mourning
and vengeance. Known as Tomb
Banshees, these embittered spirits
are fated to shriek their wailing cries
and haunt the material plane.

Many wielders of dark magic seek
to recruit Tomb Banshees to their
cause, for they are deadly opponents.
The touch of these ghostly spectres
is enough to stop a beating heart,
and their chill daggers can pass
through armour to deliver a mortal

blow. Their most formidable weapon,
however,
is their scream. The howl
of a Tomb Banshee can instantly
kill, for it freezes the blood in their
victims’ veins. The cacophony is
so painful it can rip a soul from its
physical body. Only the bravest can
withstand that aural assault and live.

Tomb Banshees are common within
the Nighthaunt processions, where
they drift between other spectral
formations while delivering their
spiteful shrieks to destroy the foe.
Although they are most frequently
reported as acting alone, there have
been whispers following the recent
eruption of undead invasions of
several Tomb Banshees working
in unison. At least five joined
together – dubbed the Hellchoir
of the Banelands – as part of the
army of Baron Finalem. Their
screams were instrumental in the
successful reclamation of the great
burial grounds known as the Vale of
Remembrance. There are also tales of
a Tomb Banshee leading a vast wave
of Myrmourn Banshees, the most
famous being the host out of Aqshy
known as the Burning Scream.

Wraith Hosts

30

WRAITH HOSTS

The stench of open graves and mildewed cloth, the unnatural chilling of the air along with the clank of chains and
unearthly moans – these announce the presence of the wraith host. Directed by more powerful wills or by their
own malicious instincts, wraith hosts of the Nighthaunt processions come to extinguish life wherever they find it.

Misery loves company, and there is
no company more dolorous than the
ghostly legions of Shyish. They are
the lesser spirits of the Nighthaunt
processions – the foot soldiers, as
it were – although they are unlike
the troops of any other army. They
do not march, and even the least of
the spirits floats or glides. All are
ethereal spectres wearing tattered
robes that glow from within. Enemy
arrows and blades not guided by a
stalwart wi l l pass straight through
the gheists.

All wraiths – no matter which
terrifying form they come in –
hate the living. Their spite-filled
memories are magnified or twisted
in the afterlife by Nagash’s malefic
curses. Gathered together,
they are a
howling gale of vengeful spirits that
sweeps over the battlefields of the
Mortal Realms.

GLAIVEWRAITH
STALKERS

Glaivewraith Stalkers prowl in packs,
as they did in life. Where once they
were mounted hunters that rode
down their quarr y for the thr i l l of
the chase before the kill, they are
now a strange amalgamation of
horse and rider. Each of the crook-
backed spectres is armed with a
wickedly sharp glaive. Once levelled
at a target, the Glaivewraith Stalker
that bears the weapon never rests
until their prey is slain. Always, no
many how many twists or turns
their journey might require, their
blade is drawn directly to the heart
of their victim, just as a compass
needle is pulled always to its point
of reference. The glaive even aims at
targets out of sight or over distant
horizons, for quarr y that has been
thus marked has no other destiny but
to join the Glaivewraiths in death.

Glaivewraith Stalkers drift steadily
after their prey, often advancing to
the heartbeat thump of a drum made
from human skin. Any thr i l l of the

chase has been long replaced by a
cold and unforgiving drive. For the
hunted there can be no escape, but
the same can be said for the hunter
– for a Glaivewraith, there is no
satisfaction in slaying their quarry,
and a new target is immediately
marked for the ritual to begin again.

‘The Glaivewraith,

it comes for you,

It

follows you about.

There’s no escape from what

it will do,

Old Bones has found you out.’

- Lyrian lullaby

GRIMGHAST REAPERS

In life, those who were to become
Grimghast Reapers were careful and
meticulous killers. They planned and
plotted, worrying over every facet of
the illicit deeds that they committed.
All took great pains to see that no
blood would fall upon their hands,
for the deaths were brought about
through whispered lies, poison or
the employment of mercenaries.
In death, Nagash has seen fit to
punish such souls with everlasting
bloodshed in the most frenzied
and obvious manner possible.
Blindfolded with strips of sanctified
shrouds, Grimghast Reapers cannot
see, not even with the witch-sight
granted other spirit forms. This is
part of their curse to keep them in a
state of eternal rage.

Armed with slasher scythes,
Grimghast Reapers are
indiscriminate killers. They never
cease in their long sweeping strokes
that mercilessly cut down the
enemy a rank at a time, and they
never tire. Like horrible clockwork
figures, they endlessly repeat their
deadly shearing strikes. The grim
spectres move quickly, hovering
down to attack, but doing so with
jarring motions that are antithetical
to the graceful movements of the
living. They seem to start and stop,
travelling in convulsive bursts, yet
they are fast for all that.

The champions of the Grimghast
Reapers are known as Extollers of
Shyish. Once spiritual
leaders that
spoke out in life against Nagash, they
are now harbingers of death. Each
bears a massive bell – a death knell –
whose sombre toll strikes to honour
the Supreme Master of Death. The
sound rings especially true when
the great bell batters the flesh of
the living – the resulting resonance
is so disturbing that it can shake
a mortal’s soul loose from their
physical form.

CHAINRASP HORDES

The most numerous of all the spirits
that join Nighthaunt processions
are the Chainrasp Hordes. These
gheists are created from the spirits
of the most vicious and irredeemable
criminals to have lived in the
Mortal Realms.

The form of a Chainrasp echoes the
circumstances of their death. They
who met their end in chains wear the
same bonds in death. Those weighted
down with heavy iron cannonballs
or trammelled with thick manacles
drag that same load with them.
Yet no matter what they haul,
Chainrasps seek to bludgeon, claw or
sink a blade into any living creature
they come across. While enemy
weapons might pass harmlessly
through the chained spectres, their
own spiked clubs and rusty swords
cleave flesh and break bone as easily
as any physical equivalent.

The spectres of the Chainrasp
Hordes are lesser spirits, held
together in the afterlife only by
Nagash’s
curse and by their own
never-ending spite. That hatred leads
to a madness so all-consuming that
when the darksome beings gather in
sufficient number,
they leave behind
a spiritual frostbite. Over time, this
intense negative energy saps their
victims’ wi l l to fight, making them
easy prey when the Chainrasps move
to attack.


PAGEBREAK
Chainrasp champions are known
as Dreadwardens – the wardens of
unrepentant souls. The candles they
bear are like beacons to the spirits
under their charge, casting a dread
light that the Chainrasps believe
wi l l
lead to their freedom. In fact,
it is this eerie glow that helps bind
the impenitent to eternal servitude.
The Chainrasps may have thought
death would be an escape from their
terrible imprisonment, but truly,
it
was only the beginning.

BLADEGHEIST
REVENANTS

Moving like a ghostly cyclone, the
creatures known as Bladegheist
Revenants spin in a frenetic
fashion. They are souls taken
from those who met particularly
tormenting ends – those sealed in
spike-ridden encasements, choked
beneath water or buried alive.
Their last living thoughts were a
frenzy of desperation, a last flurry
of defiance in an attempt to break
free. Thanks to Nagash’s
terrible
curse, that horrible ending moment
has been preserved forever in the
Bladegheist Revenants.

Still
lashing out in a blind frenzy,
each Bladegheist Revenant has now
been armed with a long sword – a
tomb greatblade – that stands nearly
as tall as a man. In their maddened
fur y the revenants spin in arcs,
their own momentum pulling them
forward in a destructive path that
cleaves through the enemy’s ranks.
Although their other senses are
numbed, trapped as they are in a
final push for freedom, Bladegheist
Revenants can feel the presence
of what they imagine to be their
captors. Any nearby Spirit Torments
or Chainrasp Hordes serve to spur
the whirling spectres on to even
further manic efforts to escape their
imagined doom.

MYRMOURN BANSHEES

The Myrmourn Banshees have a
diabolical hunger,
for they feast
solely upon magic. No enemy
spell is safe from the ravenous
spirits, and they haunt the Mortal
Realms in search of arcane energies
to consume.

Myrmourn Banshees are drawn to
magic as carrion are drawn to the
dead, and such is their bitterness
towards life that any mortal creature
in their way is likely to receive a swift
jab from their cursed chill daggers.

Once, these women were
practitioners of magic and seekers
of eldritch knowledge, yet in their
studies of lore they failed to pay
proper respect to the Supreme Lord
of the Undead. Upon their demise,
Nagash decided that since in life they
desired magic so much, they should
continue that way in the afterlife.

Wrapped in tattered robes and
funeral shrouds, Myrmourn
Banshees have lost the ability to use
their physical senses, and can now
only detect the magic that they crave
and the living creatures that they
jealously detest. An opposing wizard
has little chance of successfully
casting spells near a large enough
pack of Myrmourn Banshees, for
they wi l l simply devour incantations
before they can have any effect.
The sudden infusion of arcane
energies causes the lithe spectres to
gleam with fell power – especially
their chill daggers – though it does
nothing to sate their greed for
more magic.

DREADSCYTHE
HARRIDANS

Dreadscythe Harridans were once
healers and nurturing types, women
devoted to easing suffering and
prolonging life. It is, doubtlessly,
these very offenses that drew the
attention of Nagash. To deny the
Great Necromancer his souls at their
rightfully appointed time is to earn a
cold ire that is unlike any other.

Nagash waits for no mortal, nor
does he tolerate any interfering
with his plans. It was imperative
that he teach any such miscreants
and interlopers a lesson. Truly,
none would forestall death. So did
Nagash prepare a special reward in
the afterlife for those guilty of such
crimes – the dreadful Harridan
Curse. This baleful hex twisted the
offending souls, reshaping them
into something that was quite the
opposite of what they once were.

31

Where there were once healing
hands now grow bonescythes
– horrible reaping instruments
intended for murder. If their
demeanour had been gentle and
caring, the Dreadscythe Harridans
– as they came to be called – are
now raging killers. In life the sight
of blood and injuries stirred in
them compassion, but now it only
incites greater fury. And lips that
uttered gentle and soothing words
to ease a patient’s qualms now issue
incomprehensible bloodthirsty
shrieks that cause all but the
bravest to quake with fear. Unable
to enunciate, the Harridans only
grow angrier. Those who led in life
do so also in death – at the fore of
Dreadscythe Harridan packs are the
Slasher Crones, the most formidable
killers of all their kind.

Perhaps the most disturbing
consequence of the Harridan Curse
is that the minds of the former
healers are intact and aware.
Most spectres lose all aspects of
their mortal lives, but not so the
Dreadscythe Harridans. While they
retain their old memories they can
no longer control their actions, so
each is cognisant of and bears fu l l
witness to the atrocities that they
commit, yet can do nothing to halt.

‘The grave is wide,

the grave is deep,

Pray do not come for me in my sleep.

Every Lyrian must always learn,

Those that go,

sometimes return.

Born of night,

they hunt

With unseeing eyes, dead and stark.

The grave is wide,

the grave is deep,

Blessed forever

to always sleep.’

Spectral Shock Forces

32

SPECTRAL SHOCK FORCES

Weaving in between the larger formations of the Nighthaunt processions are smaller shock forces. As the wraith
hordes surround the foe these hard-hitting spectres strike, unleashing their hatred upon the living. For many
enemies, the last sight they witness are Spirit Hosts, Hexwraiths or a Black Coach bearing down upon them.

SPIRIT HOSTS

Some of the most commonly
encountered wraiths across the
Mortal Realms are the Spirit Hosts.
Even before the Shyish necroquake
Spirit Hosts were known to stalk
ancient cairns, battlefields or sites
of horrific trauma. They rise out of
the ground, mist-like, for they are
the spirits of the damned, stripped
of body and individuality and
fused into a roiling mass of ethereal
energy. Amidst the swirls are deathly
faces and grasping talons that snatch
out to grab and torment the living.

Spirit Hosts are amongst the lowest
of spectral forms. They are clusters
of souls merged into one spirit cloud,
and like the bodies piled into a mass
grave, they are devoid of any identity.
All memory and form has dissolved

save for a cold hatred of the living,
for in mortal-kind they recognise a
flicker of that which they have lost.

Spirit Hosts are deadly foes – their
phantom weapons and raking claws
rend not only flesh, but the soul
as well. Their chill touch can pass
through armour and bone to grasp
organs or stab deep into vitals. When
the processions muster for war Spirit
Hosts flock to join them.

HEXWRAITHS

Also known as Reaper Knights,
Hexwraiths are fell riders astride
ghostly steeds. They charge forward
illuminated by strange balefires,
swinging their eerily glowing scythes
in deadly arcs. A single swipe from
such a weapon can cut the cord

between a soul and its body, allowing
it to be claimed by the wielder. The
flickering flames that surround
Hexwraiths are the smouldering
remnants of the spirit-stuff these
dread cavalr ymen have stolen during
their rampages.

In the past, Hexwraiths rose to haunt
battlefields, riding down mortals
in order to claim their souls. The
spectral riders were often recruited
as shock elements into Nagash’s
undead legions, but since the Shyish
necroquake it is in the Nighthaunt
processions where the Hexwraiths
are most often encountered. Striking
hard and fast, they gallop over rivers
and through walls to pursue the
enemy,
their cruel laughter echoing
across the battlefield as their terrified
foes attempt to flee in vain.

33

THE BLACK COACH

The mightiest blow or spell can
unbind the spirits of the undead,
destroying them. However,
the
most powerful of these creatures –
most notably Soulblight vampires,
lichelords or the most adept of
Necromancers – can survive
the destruction of their material
form. Driven by a dark will, their
malevolent animus begins to gather
and re-form a new physical shell.

The Black Coaches are funerar y
carriages from the underworlds.
Within these arcane vehicles any
tangible remains – be they ashes,
bones, or leathery scraps of skin –
are gathered in a casket that offers
a safe haven in which the banished
entity can reform. The dormant
occupant can feed upon the energies
of death, drinking in agony and grief
in order to grow stronger.

Pulled by four skeletal Nightmare
steeds, the Black Coach speeds
forward at a considerable pace.
The driver is a Cairn Wraith who

either wields a two-handed reaper
scythe or employs the nightmarish
soulreach grasp, their spectral
hands ranging out impossibly far
to pluck out a victim’s very soul.
Hovering about the unholy carriage
are wraith-like relic bearers, each
carr ying an artefact important to the
recovering being. The Black Coach
is phantasmal
in nature, unbound
by the physical world. Its wheels
run over pits and precipices,
leaving
the ground altogether in order to
clear obstacles, although it may also
choose to simply pass through them.

Black Coaches are drawn towards
battlefields, for there the power of
death is strongest. From atop the
coach the Cairn Wraith targets
nearby enemies while the iron-
bound wheels and pounding hooves
of the steeds crush foes beneath
them. Gliding from the skies
above, the relic bearers dart in to
deliver blows with their spectral
talons. All of this violence only
helps to fuel the death magic that
is absorbed by the malefic thing in

the coffin. By drawing off those dark
energies, the being within the casket
grows stronger,
its aura of malice
expanding ever outwards. As this
happens, the Black Coach becomes
an even deadlier threat to its foes.

On first tasting death, the Black
Coach speeds forward before
shimmering jets of balefire extend
from the wheels, acting like scythes
to cut down enemies. When the
coach is immersed in sufficient
energies it flickers, allowing it to
disappear only to reappear in a
more advantageous position. As the
hellish vehicle continues to absorb
power, the souls of the freshly slain
are subsumed, healing the coach and
exuding a nimbus of fell light. With
enough death magic nearby,
the
witchfires of the Black Coach blaze
outwards, scorching any who draw
near. So does the Black Coach hurtle
across the battlefield, reaping the
foe and feeding its dark passenger.
Onwards it rolls, growing ever more
powerful until it becomes a nigh-
unstoppable force of death.

PAINTING YOUR
NIGHTHAUNTS

Whether you have never painted a Citadel Miniature in your life or are a master of the brush with decades of
experience, the prospect of painting a Nighthaunt procession offers a unique and exciting challenge. Following
are some tips and examples to get you started with painting your own spectral horde.

There is nothing like the sight of
a fully painted army of Citadel
Miniatures. There is real satisfaction
to be had in adding your chosen
colours, teasing out the finely
sculpted details, and truly making
your miniatures collection your
own. After all, one painted spectre
looks great, but an entire phantasmal
army brought together through
shared colours is something even
more fantastic. For those of us that
are completionists, there is also
immense gratification in watching
your collection grow as you add each
new painted figure to the ranks of
the finished models.

There’s no right or wrong way to go
about painting your collection of
miniatures. Some people revel in
treating each miniature as a work of
art,
lavishing attention on every inch
of every model and painstaking ly
crafting scenic bases. Others prefer
a far simpler approach with basic

paint jobs that allow them to quickly
assemble legions of finished models.
And, of course, there is plenty of
middle ground for those that enjoy
painting their troops but devote even
more attention to key figures such as
heroes, war machines and monsters.
Again, there is no one way to paint,
just the way that works best for you.

The spirit-ridden army of the
Nighthaunts has its own ghastly
aesthetic – tormented apparitions
that have risen straight out of the
underworlds. Your first decision
wi l l be to choose a paint scheme for
your miniatures. The colours you
select are very likely to influence the
character of your army – are they
pale and cold, glowing eerily, or
faded almost to nothing? Examples
of the different colours Nighthaunts
can exhibit are shown on the
following pages and in the images
throughout this book, but of course
it is also possible to create your own.

Base paints contain a high percentage of pigment, and
deliver bold, intense colour that provides the foundation for
the paint scheme. Neat basecoats are key to a great-looking
miniature, and two thin coats are almost always better than
one thick coat.

Shade paints are almost the consistency of ink, and are
designed to run into the model’s recesses to create depth and
contrast. They are usually applied all over an area as a wash,
or painted directly into recesses such as the gaps between
armour plates.

Dry paints are applied using a technique called dr ybrushing,
which involves passing a very lightly loaded brush rapidly
across the model to apply a dusting of colour to the
raised detail. It’s a very quick way of adding highlights to
a miniature.

Layer paints are brighter colours than Base paints, and have
a smoother consistency. They are usually applied all over
an underlying Base colour to achieve a more vibrant hue,
or are painted in focused lines along raised areas and edges
as highlights.

Painting Citadel Miniatures is vastly
rewarding. The more you put in, the
more you get out. Before painting
your models, however, you’ ll first
need to assemble them. To begin
with, you’ ll want to follow the advice
given in the construction booklet,
but as your confidence grows you
may find yourself customising your
miniatures by combining different
weapons and modifying their poses.

The Citadel Paint System takes the
guesswork out of painting, and
uses several different formulations
of paint to best match different
techniques. The paints are used in
a set sequence, and each enhances
the underlying colour to produce
a final scheme that belies the
straightforward techniques.

The first paint you’ ll apply is called
the undercoat. Supplied in spray
cans,
it’s formulated to provide a
smooth, even surface for the colours
that follow. Once it has dried, you
can break out your brushes and start
bringing your miniature to (un)life.
The following stage-by-stage guides
present the colours and techniques
we used to paint the Nighthaunts,
but there are no ‘rules’ as to the
colours you use for your own models
– the Mortal Realms are a limitless
canvas, so it’s entirely up to you.

Warhammer TV’s painting
tutorials have insights for
everyone, as they show you how
to paint Citadel Miniatures
from start to finish. The guides
are available for free on
games-workshop.com, and
can also be watched via the
Warhammer TV YouTube
channel. Why not take a
moment to check them out?

SHOCK AND TERROR

SHOCK AND TERROR

On Nagash’s command, Lady Olynder has organised the Nighthaunts into processions and sent them into the
Mortal Realms as the speartip of the Great Necromancer’s Soul Wars. There are many ways to collect a Nighthaunt
army, and this spread offers one example of how a procession can be assembled.

When collecting a Warhammer Age
of Sigmar army,
it’s a good idea to
have a plan. How you decide which
units to include in your Nighthaunt
procession might be based on the
look of the models, how you envision
them performing during a tabletop
battle, or could follow a narrative
found in a battletome or even one
of your own invention. There is no
single right way to collect your army,
only the way you deem best. The
goal is the same – to field a battle-
ready Nighthaunt procession! Here
is how we assembled the collection
shown below.

The first model we chose for our
procession was none other than
Lady Olynder. On the tabletop her
aura-based abilities make her an
ideal commander, boosting friendly
troops around her and punishing
those of the enemy. Our main
reason for including her, however,
was the sheer characterfulness of
the model – her veiled visage and
banshee handmaidens are the perfect
level of ghastly creepiness for our
army’s leader.

A Knight of Shrouds gives the army
another strong hero – his command

ability raises the combat potential
of nearby Nighthaunt units, so we
imagine sending him charging into
the thick of the fighting.

The largest unit in this collection
is that of the Chainrasp Hordes.
These long-suffering spirits wi l l be
used to bog the enemy down. Their
own losses can be replaced by the
Guardian of Souls, who is able to
use his nightmare lantern to make
the troops more effective, and his
Spectral Lure spell to raise more
spirits, ensuring the foe stays locked
in grinding combat. The Nighthaunts

possess a slew of small units effective
at manoeuvring around close
combats in order to launch their
own devastating assaults into enemy
flanks. Spirit Hosts are ideal for this,
and are even better when led by a
Lord Executioner, as this completes
the Execution Horde warscroll
battalion and unlocks a rules bonus.
The Spirit Torment and Chainghasts
are another combination that works
well alongside the Chainrasp Horde.
While getting into position, the
Spirit Torment augments nearby
friendly units, and heals them as
well. The Chainghasts meanwhile
excel on the front line, as the more
foes that are around them, the more
damage they wi l l cause.

Other particularly hard-hitting
Nighthaunt units include
Dreadscythe Harridans and

Bladegheist Revenants, both of
whom unleash an impressive
number of armour-piercing attacks.
A Tomb Banshee – being a single
model – can easily work around
the scrum of close combat, slaying
enemies with her shrieking howl.
Pivotal to this army’s offensive power
is the Black Coach, which gains new
abilities each battle round, growing
more deadly as the game progresses.
It also serves as another fantastic
centrepiece model. Myrmourn
Banshees can aid the attack, but
are especially useful for destroying
enemy spells.

As a whole, this Nighthaunt
procession presents a collector
and painter with a great variety
of phantasmal troops, as well as
a competitive tabletop force with
many exciting gaming options.

1. Lady Olynder, Mortarch of Grief
2. Knight of Shrouds on
Ethereal Steed
3. Tomb Banshee
4. Dreadscythe Harridans
5. Hexwraiths
6. Black Coach
7. Lord Executioner
8. Spirit Hosts
9. Spirit Torment
10. Chainghasts
11. Guardian of Souls
12. Glaivewraith Stalkers
13. Cairn Wraith
14. Grimghast Reapers
15. Chainrasp Horde
16. Bladegheist Revenants
17. Myrmourn Banshees

‘Do not cease the attack until every

living soul has been sent

to join us in

the underworlds!’

BATTLE TRAITS

ASPECTS OF THE ETHEREAL HOSTS

AURA OF DREAD

The very existence of the Nighthaunts
is a stark
reminder of the terrible fate that awaits those that have
displeased Nagash upon death. To face them in battle is
to witness these darkest fears made manifest, and can
chill the soul of even the most stoic warrior.

Subtract 1 from the Bravery characteristic of enemy
units while they are within 6" of any friendly

NIGHTHAUNT units.

DEATHLESS

SPIRITS

The spirit forms of Nighthaunt warriors are made more
formidable by the presence of their lords and masters.

FEED ON TERROR

The lords of the Nighthaunts are streng thened by the
fear they sow, and can drink deep of this uncontrolled
emotion and siphon fresh streng th.

Each time an enemy unit fails a battleshock test, pick
one friendly NIGHTHAUNT HERO within 6" of that
enemy unit. Heal 1 wound that has been allocated to
that HERO.

WAVE OF TERROR

On many occasions, entire battlelines have been
overrun by a swarming Nighthaunt host without even
raising a blade in their own defence.

Roll a dice each time you allocate a wound or mortal
wound to a friendly NIGHTHAUNT model from a
unit wholly within 12" of your general or a friendly
NIGHTHAUNT HERO. On a 6+, that wound or mortal
wound is negated.

If you make an unmodified charge roll of 10+ for a
friendly NIGHTHAUNT unit, it can fight immediately
after you complete the charge move. This does not stop
the unit from being picked to fight in the combat phase
of the same turn.

FROM THE UNDERWORLDS THEY COME

None is safe from Nagash’s
vengeance,
for the
Nighthaunts can be summoned forth from the
underworlds by their spectral overseers, appearing as if
from nowhere to assail their prey.

Instead of setting up a NIGHTHAUNT unit on the
battlefield, you can place it to one side and say that it is
set up in the underworlds as a reserve unit. You can set
up one unit in the underworlds for each unit you set up
on the battlefield. At the end of your movement phase
you can set up any of these units more than 9" from
any enemy models. This counts as their move for that
turn. Any units which are not set up on the battlefield
before the start of the fourth battle round are slain.

COMMAND ABILITY

Spectral Summons: A Nighthaunt commander can call
his ghostly minions to his side in an instant, wherever
they may be.

You can use this command ability at the start of
your movement phase. If you do so, pick a friendly
NIGHTHAUNT unit that is on the battlefield. Remove
that unit from the battlefield, and then set it up wholly
within 12" of your general and more than 9" from
any enemy models. This counts as their move for that
movement phase.

RETURNING SLAIN MODELS

Several Nighthaunt abilities allow you to return slain models to a unit.
When you do so, set up the models one at a time within 1" of a model
from the unit they are returning to (this can be a model you returned to
the unit earlier in the same phase).

The slain models you return to a unit can only be set up within 3" of an
enemy unit if one or more models from the unit they are returning to are
already within 3" of an enemy unit.

If the roll is equal to or greater than that enemy

weapon. On a 5+, the attacking unit suffers
1 mortal wound after all of its attacks have
been made.

Cloaked in Shadow : Eerily intangible,

next hero phase, that unit cannot retreat. In
addition, until the start of your next hero phase,
that unit cannot fight in the combat phase

caster’s own vitality.

Lifestealer has a casting value of 7. If

Battleplan: Death From Within

BATTLEPLAN

DEATH FROM WITHIN

The mightiest fortresses of
the Mortal Realms are nigh
unassailable, their towering walls
and imposing defences all but
impervious to assault by land or
air. Yet to Nagash’s Nighthaunt
hosts, able to tear through the veil
of reality from the underworlds
wherever their immortal master
commands, such defences are
rendered entirely obsolete.

The battle is being fought in a
courtyard behind the stronghold’s
main walls – an area thought safe
from assault so long as the walls
could be held…

THE ARMIES

Each player picks an army as
described in the core rules. One
player is the Nighthaunt player and
their opponent is the Defender.
The Nighthaunt player must use a
Nighthaunt army.

THE BATTLEFIELD

The Defender sets up any terrain as
they see fit, though they must set up
at least one terrain feature wholly
within each of their territories.

SIEGE TARGETS

After setting the battlefield, the
Defender picks one terrain feature
in each of their territories to be the
Nighthaunt player’s siege targets (see
Glorious Victory).

SET-UP

The Defender sets up their army
first. Defending units must be set up
wholly within one of the Defender’s
two territories.

The Nighthaunt player then
alternates setting up one unit wholly
within their territory, and one unit
in the underworlds (see From The
Underworlds They Come on page
53), repeating these steps until they
have set up all of their units.

FIRST TURN

The Nighthaunt player has the first
turn in the first battle round.

TAKEN OFF GUARD
The defender’s
forces have reacted
with admirable haste to the sudden
danger within their midst, but are
still reeling from the unexpected
quar ter from which they are now
assailed, throwing their command
structure into disarray.

The Defender cannot spend any
command points in the first
battle round.

UNDERWORLD ATTACK
A fresh wave of Nighthaunts
lies
in wait to pour forth from the
underworlds and sweep into the
stronghold’s hapless defenders.

Add 1 to charge rolls for
NIGHTHAUNT units that arrived
from reserve in the same turn.


PAGEBREAK
59

GLORIOUS VICTORY

The game ends at the end of the fifth
battle round.

The Nighthaunt player wins a major
victor y if they control both siege
targets at the end of the game (see
right). The Defender wins a major
victory if the Nighthaunt player
controls neither siege target. Any
other result is a draw.

CONTROLLING
SIEGE TARGETS

The siege targets in the Defender’s
territories are controlled by the last
player to have any models within 1"
of the terrain feature. If both players
have any models within 1" of a siege
target terrain feature,
it is controlled
by the Defender.

Path To Glory

PATH TO GLORY

Path to Glory campaigns centre around collecting and fighting battles with a warband in the Age of Sigmar.
Champions fight each other and gather followers to join them in their quest for glory, taking advantage of this age
of unending battle to win glory and renown.

warband and the rewards they
can receive for fighting battles.
The warband tables included in
this battletome let you collect a
warband with the Nighthaunt
allegiance, but other Warhammer
Age of Sigmar publications include
warband tables to let you collect
other warbands from the Grand
Alliances of Order, Chaos, Death
and Destruction.

start with a Follower’s Reward.
No champion or unit can start the
Path to Glory campaign with more
than one reward each.

6. Finally,
give your warband a
name, one that wi l l inspire respect
and dread in your rivals. Your
warband is now complete, and
you can fight your first battle.
Good luck!

TO WAR!

Having created a warband, you can
now fight battles with it against
other warbands taking part in the
campaign. You can fight battles as
and when you wish, and can use
any of the battleplans available for
Warhammer Age of Sigmar. There
are some battleplans, for example in

the General’s Handbook , that have

been designed specifically for use in
Path to Glory campaigns.

The units you use for a game must
be those on your roster. Units can
either be fielded at their fu l l roster
strength, or broken down into
smaller units, as long as no unit
is smaller than the minimum size
shown on its warscroll.

Any casualties suffered by a warband
are assumed to have been replaced
in time for its next battle. If your
champion is slain in a battle,
it is
assumed that they were merely
injured, and they are back to fu l l
strength for your next game, thirsty
for vengeance!

In order to take part in a Path to
Glory campaign, you wi l l need two
or more players. All players wi l l
need to have at least one HERO,
who is their champion, and must
then create a warband to follow and
fight beside their champion during
the campaign.

The players fight battles against each
other using the warbands they have
created. The results of these battles
wi l l gain their warband favour. The
warband wi l l swell in numbers as
more warriors flock to their banner,
while existing troops become
more powerful.

After gaining enough favour or
growing your warband enough to
dominate all others through sheer
weight of numbers, you wi l l be
granted a final test. Succeed, and
your glory wi l l be affirmed for all
time, and you wi l l be crowned as the
victor of the campaign.

CREATING A WARBAND

When creating a Path to Glory
warband, do not select your army in
the normal manner. Instead, your
army consists of a mighty champion
battling to earn the favour of the
gods, and their entire band of loyal
followers. As you wage war against
other warbands, your own warband
wi l l grow, and existing units wi l l
become grizzled veterans.

WARBAND ROSTER

The details and progress of each
warband need to be recorded
on a warband roster, which
you can download for free
from games-workshop.com.

To create a warband, simply follow
these steps and record the results on
your warband roster :

2. Next, choose your warband’s
champion by selecting one of the
options from your allegiance’s
champion table. The champion
you choose wi l l determine the
number of followers in your
warband. Give your champion a
suitably grand name, and write
this down on your warband roster.

3. Having picked your champion,
the next step is to generate your
starting followers. These can
be chosen from the followers
tables for your allegiance. If your
allegiance has more than one
followers table you can freely
choose which ones you use,
selecting all of your followers
from a single table or from several.
Instead of choosing, you can place
your destiny in the hands of fate
and roll on the followers tables
instead. To make a followers roll,
pick a column from one of the
followers tables and then roll
a dice.

4. Your
followers need to be
organised into units. The followers
table tells you how many models
the unit has. Follower units
cannot include additional models,
but they can otherwise take any
options listed on their warscroll.
Record all of the information
about your followers on your
warband roster.

1. First, pick an allegiance for your
warband. Each allegiance has its
own set of warband tables that are
used to generate the units in the

followers, your champion can start

GAINING GLORY

All of the players in the campaign
are vying for glory. The amount
of glory they have received is
represented by the Glory Points that
the warband has accumulated. Glory
can be increased by fighting and
winning battles, as described next.
As a warband’s glory increases, it
wi l l also attract additional followers,
and a warband’s champion may be
granted rewards.

Warbands receive Glory Points after
a battle is complete. If the warband
drew or lost the battle,
it receives 1
Glory Point. If it won the battle,
it
receives D3 Glory Points (re-roll a
result of 1 if it won a major victory).

Add the Glory Points you scored to
the total recorded on your roster.
Once you have won 10 Glory Points,
you wi l l have a chance to win the
campaign, as described below.

REWARDS OF BATTLE

Each allegiance has its own set of
rewards tables. After each battle you
can take one of the three following
options. Alternatively, roll a D3 to
determine which option to take:

D3 Option
1
Additional Followers: More

followers flock to your banner.
Either select a new unit or
roll for a random one from
a follower table, then add it
to your warband roster. You
can choose from any of your
own follower tables, or from
any of the follower tables
from an allied warband table
i.e. a warband table whose
allegiance is from the same
Grand Alliance as your own. In
either case, if you wish to add a
unit from a follower table that
requires more than ‘1 roll’, you
must also reduce your Glory
Points total by 1 (if you do not
have enough Glory Points,
you cannot choose a unit from
such a table). Once 5 new units
have joined your warband, you
wi l l have a chance to win the
campaign, as described below.

2

Champion’s Reward: Your

champion’s prowess grows. Roll
on your allegiance’s champion
rewards table. Note the result
on your warband roster. If you
roll a result the champion has
already received, roll again until
you get a different result.

3

Follower’s Reward: Your

warriors become renowned
for mighty deeds. Pick a unit
of followers (not one from an
allied warband table), then roll
on your allegiance’s
followers
rewards table. Note the result
on your warband roster. If you
roll a result the unit has already
received, roll again until you get
a different result.

ETERNAL GLORY

There are two ways to win a Path
to Glory campaign; either by Blood
or by Might. To win by Blood
your warband must first have 10
Glory Points. To win by Might
your warband must have at least
5 additional units of followers. In
either case, you must then fight
and win one more battle to win the
campaign. If the next battle you fight
is tied or lost, you do not receive
any Glory Points – just keep on
fighting battles until you either win
the campaign… or another player
wins first!

You can shorten or lengthen a
campaign by lowering or raising
the number of Glory Points needed
to win by Blood, or the numbers of
extra units that must join it to win
by Might. For example, for a shorter
campaign, you could say that a
warband only needs 5 Glory Points
before the final fight, or for a longer
one, say that 15 are needed.

WARSCROLL BATTALION

NIGHTHAUNT PROCESSION

The vanguard of the Soul Wars, the Nighthaunts press forward relentlessly. To a mortal, the approach of a
Nighthaunt army is a terrifying sight. However, to Nagash the procession is as he himself has ordained – an
ordered affair of minions driven forward by the malign willpower of the more powerful spirits amongst them.

ORGANISATION

A Nighthaunt Procession consists of the following
warscroll battalions:

•

1 Shroudguard

6 warscroll battalions chosen in any combination
from the following list:

- The Condemned
- Chainguard
- Execution Horde

DESCRIPTION

Lady Olynder is a named character that is
a single model. She is armed with the Staff
of Midnight.

COMPANIONS: Lady Olynder is accompanied
by two Banshee Handmaidens, who are armed
with Spectral Claws. For rules purposes, the
Banshee Handmaidens are treated in the same
manner as a mount.

FLY : This model can fly.

ABILITIES

Ethereal: Creatures whose bodies have rotted
away are difficult to harm with ordinary weapons.

Ignore modifiers (positive or negative) when
making save rolls for attacks that target
this model.

Frightful Touch: With but a single, bone-
chilling touch of their spectral claws, the banshee
handmaidens can still a beating hear t.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with the Banshee Handmaidens’ Spectral Claws
is 6, that attack inflicts 1 mortal wound and the
attack sequence ends (do not make a wound or
save roll).

Grave-sands of Time: Lady Olynder’s

handmaidens bear gifts from Nagash,
including a
Grave-sand Hourglass through which mor tal
life
itself slips.

Once per battle,
in your hero phase, you can
choose either to inflict D6 mortal wounds on an
enemy HERO within 6" of this model, or heal D6
wounds that have been allocated to this model.

L ifting the Veil: Those that see what lies
beneath Lady Olynder’s veil die with deathmask
expressions of shock and horror frozen upon their
faces – their dying grief serving only to feed the
Mortarch’s
insatiable desire.

At the start of your hero phase, pick an enemy
unit within 12" of this model that is visible to her
and roll a dice. On a 1, nothing happens. On a
2+, that unit suffers a number of mortal wounds
equal to the roll. In addition, if any enemy
models are slain by this ability,
immediately
heal D3 wounds that have been allocated to
this model.

Mortarch of Grief: Chosen by Nagash to serve
as his Mortarch of Grief, Lady Olynder’s very
presence serves as a psychological weapon of
terrible potency.

Add 1 to the number of models that flee from
enemy units that fail a battleshock test while they
are within 12" of this model.

Wail of the Damned: The Handmaidens can

loose a soul-piercing shriek that contains within
its harrowing notes all the woes of the realms.

At the start of your shooting phase, roll 2D6
for each enemy unit within 10" of this model.
If the roll for the unit is higher than its Bravery
characteristic,
it suffers D3 mortal wounds.

MAGIC

Lady Olynder is a WIZARD. She can attempt
to cast two different spells in each of your hero
phases, and attempt
to unbind two spells in each
enemy hero phase. She knows the Arcane Bolt,
Mystic Shield and Grief-stricken spells.

Grief-stricken: Lady Olynder’s

incantations
can cause a pall of misery and utter desolation to
descend upon her enemies, so that their limbs feel
leaden and their very will to live is sapped.

Grief-stricken has a casting value of 7. If
successfully cast, pick an enemy unit that is
within 18" of the caster and visible to them. Until
your next hero phase, subtract 1 from hit rolls for
attacks made by that unit and add 1 to hit rolls
for attacks made with melee weapons that target
that unit.

COMMAND ABILITIES

No Rest For the Wicked: Should the spectral

forms of her minions be banished or destroyed,
Lady Olynder will wrench their souls back from
the underworlds time and again until her will
is done.

You can use this command ability in your hero
phase if this model is your general and is on
the battlefield. If you do so, you can return 1
slain model to each friendly SUMMONABLE
NIGHTHAUNT unit that is within 12" of a
friendly model with this command ability.

THE CRAVEN KING

DESCRIPTION

Kurdoss Valentian is a named character
that is single model. He is armed with the
Sepulchral Sceptre.

COMPANIONS: Kurdoss Valentian is
accompanied by two Wraith Heralds, who are
armed with Spectral Claws. For rules purposes,
the Wraith Heralds are treated in the same
manner as a mount.

FLY : This model can fly.

ABILITIES

Ethereal: Creatures whose bodies have rotted
away are difficult to harm with ordinary weapons.

Ignore modifiers (positive or negative) when
making save rolls for attacks that target
this model.

Frightful Touch: Gifted with the touch of the
grave, a touch from the spectral claws of Kurdoss’
wraith heralds can silence the most vibrant
of hear ts.

Soul-crushing Smite: When backed by the

full measure of Kurdoss Valentian’s might and
bitterness,
the Sepulchral Sceptre can blast his
victim’s
soul clean out of its body.

If the unmodified wound roll for an attack made
with the Sepulchral Sceptre is 6, that attack has a
Damage characteristic of D6 instead of D3.

Suffer No Rival: Never is the Craven King’s
bitterness more evident than when he lashes out
at those he sees as rivals to his hollow power.

You can re-roll failed hit rolls for attacks made
with the Sepulchral Sceptre if the target is an
enemy general.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with the Wraith Heralds’ Spectral Claws is 6,
that attack inflicts 1 mortal wound and the
attack sequence ends (do not make a wound or
save roll).

If I Cannot Rule, None Shall Rule!: In the

presence of Kurdoss Valentian’s
all-consuming
bitterness and the cruel malice of his heralds, the
commands of enemy generals turn to dust in their
mouths even as they issue them.

At the start of the enemy hero phase, after
the opposing player receives their command
point for that turn, roll a dice. On a 5+,
subtract 1 from the enemy player’s command
points, to a minimum of 0, and you receive 1
command point.

with Fellreaper.

MOUNT: Reikenor the Grimhailer’s mount,
Kyllaron, attacks with Ghostly Hooves
and Teeth.

FLY : This model can fly.

ABILITIES

Corpse Candles: When Reikenor prepares to
cast a spell by snuffing out the flame of a corpse
candle, he can drain his own or a victim’s
essence
to help fuel his sorcery.

In your hero phase, before this model attempts
to cast a spell, you can say that it wi l l snuff out a
corpse candle. If you do so, pick either this model
or an enemy model within 12" of this model.
That model suffers 1 mortal wound. If the mortal
wound was suffered by an enemy model, add 1 to
the casting roll; if the mortal wound was suffered
by this model, add 3 to the casting roll.

Ethereal: Creatures whose bodies have rotted
away are difficult to harm with ordinary weapons.

Ignore modifiers (positive or negative) when
making save rolls for attacks that target
this model.

Frightful Touch: The wraith-touch of Reikenor
is imbued with the pure finality of death, an
unholy force that is transferred to the blade of the
scythe Fellreaper. The weapon has a penchant
for
ghosting through flesh to still a beating hear t.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with Fellreaper is 6, that attack inflicts 2 mortal
wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not
make a wound or save roll).

Reaped Like Corn: Fellreaper can be swung in
great sweeping arcs, cutting down whole ranks of
enemy warriors.

You can re-roll failed hit rolls for attacks
made with Fellreaper if the target unit has 5 or
more models.

MAGIC

Reikenor the Grimhailer is a WIZARD. He can
attempt
to cast one spell in your hero phase, and
attempt
to unbind one spell in the enemy hero
phase. He knows the Arcane Bolt, Mystic Shield
and Wraithstorm spells.

Wraithstorm: Reikenor tears the souls from his
victims and commands them to assail their allies.

Wraithstorm has a casting value of 7. If
successfully cast, pick an enemy unit within
12" of the caster that is visible to them. That
unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. If any models
in that unit are slain as a result of this spell,
that unit immediately suffers an additional D3
mortal wounds.

DESCRIPTION

A Black Coach is a single model driven by a
Cairn Wraith armed with a Soulreach Grasp or a
Reaper Scythe.

STEEDS AND CREW: The Black Coach is drawn
by four Nightmares that attack with their Hooves
and Teeth. Three Relic Bearers accompany the
Black Coach, and can attack with their Spectral
Claws. For rules purposes, the Nightmares and
Relic Bearers are treated in the same manner as
a mount.

FLY : This model can fly.

ABILITIES

Ethereal: Creatures whose bodies have rotted
away are difficult to harm with ordinary weapons.

Ignore modifiers (positive or negative) when
making save rolls for attacks that target
this model.

Frightful Touch: The icy touch of the Black
Coach’s Wraith crew is so fell and chill that a mere
scratch from them can still a beating hear t.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with
the Cairn Wraith’s Reaper Scythe is 6, that attack
inflicts 2 mortal wounds and the attack sequence
ends (do not make a wound or save roll).

In addition, if the unmodified hit roll for an
attack made with the Relic Bearers’ Spectral
Claws is 6, that attack inflicts 1 mortal wound
and the attack sequence ends (do not make a
wound or save roll).

Evocation of Death: The Black Coach absorbs
death magic, swelling with power as it consumes
more and more of that darksome force.

Four th Level – Insubstantial Form: The Black

Coach seems to flicker in and out of reality,
making it all but impossible to trap and envelop.

This model can retreat and charge in the
same turn.

Fifth Level – Witch-fire: Balefire crackles and

arcs from the charging steeds and spinning wheels.

In your hero phase, roll a dice for each enemy
unit within 3" of this model. On a 4+, that unit
suffers D3 mortal wounds.

Reaped Like Corn: The scythes w ielded by these
ghostly warriors can be swung in great sweeping
arcs, cutting down whole ranks of enemy warriors.

You can re-roll failed hit rolls for attacks made
with this model’s Reaper Scythe if the target unit
has 5 or more models.

At
the start of each battle round, roll 3 dice
for each BLACK COACH on the battlefield.
For each 4+, that BLACK COACH gains a level
of power. Levels of power are cumulative and
last for the rest of the battle. They grant the
following abilities:

First Level – Nimbus of Power : A supernatural

glow emanates from the Black Coach,
invigorating the power within.

its fell touch

In your hero phase, heal D3 wounds that have
been allocated to this model. In addition, at
the start of your hero phase, pick 1 friendly

SUMMONABLE NIGHTHAUNT unit wholly

within 12" of this model and return D3 slain
models to that unit. The returning models must
be set up within 12" of this model.

Second Level – Unholy Vigour : Dark magic

lends the vehicle unnatural
speed and empowers
its accompanying Nightmares and Wraiths
to lash
out with blurring sw iftness.

Re-roll hit rolls of 1 for this model’s melee
weapons. In addition, this model can run and
charge in the same turn.

Third Level – Spectral Scy thes: These phantom

blades look intangible but can slice flesh as easily
as if forged from the finest steel.

After this model completes a charge move, pick
an enemy unit within 1" of this model and roll a
dice. On a 2+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

Shyish Reaper

ENDLESS SPELL WARSCROLL

SHYISH REAPER

The soul-hungry Shyish Reaper is the ultimate manifestation of finality and death. Its blade passes through armour
with ease to cleave flesh and rip away a mortal’s soul, sending it screaming into the underworlds.

DESCRIPTION

Shyish Reaper is a single model.

Summon Shyish Reaper : The wizard sweeps

down their arm as they utter this spell’s final
incantation, and a fearsome scythe formed of
purest amethyst magic tears through the wizard’s
foes with unstoppable force.

Only NAGASH, SUPREME LORD OF THE
UNDEAD and NIGHTHAUNT WIZARDS

can attempt
to cast Summon Shyish Reaper. It
has a casting value of 7. If successfully cast, set
up a Shyish Reaper model wholly within 6" of
the caster.

PREDATORY:

Shyish Reaper is a predatory
endless spell. It can move up to 8" and can fly.

ABILITIES

Sweeping Death: Once unleashed, a Shyish
Reaper will carve through its prey, slicing through
body and soul alike.

When this model is set up, the player who set it
up can immediately make a move with it.

Soul Reaper : A Shyish Reaper is always on
the hunt for souls, and can change direction
without warning to sweep through its prey from
an unexpected angle. Armour counts for naught
against the deathly touch of the enchanted blade.

Before moving a Shyish Reaper, pivot the
model on the centre of its base so that it points
lengthways in the direction you wish it to move.
Then move it in a straight line in that direction.
The initial pivot is free and does not count
towards the distance the model moves.

KEYWORDS

ENDLESS SPELL, SHYISH, SHYISH REAPER

After this model has moved, roll a dice for each
model that it moved over (including models it
moved over when it pivoted);
if the roll is equal
to or greater than the model’s Save characteristic,
that model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

Empowered by Shyish: A Shyish Reaper’s

reach
is that much greater when summoned within the
realm of its namesake.

If your battle is being fought in the Realm of
Shyish, a Shyish Reaper can move 12" instead
of 8".

VAULT OF SOULS

Vault of Souls

This summoned chest siphons souls, filling itself to overflowing with the rich spirits of mortal-kind. Ever greedy for
more, it eventually bursts, sending forth a lethal explosion of imprisoned souls to strike all those nearby.

Empowered by Shyish: Within the Realm

of Death,
it is even harder to escape the soul-
siphoning reach of a Vault of Souls.

If your battle is being fought in the Realm of
Shyish, the range of this model’s Soul Siphon
ability is 9" instead of 6".

DESCRIPTION

Vault of Souls is a single model.

Summon Vault of Souls: At the wizard’s

command, a spectral casket takes shape, eager to
feed upon the souls of the living.

Only NAGASH, SUPREME LORD OF THE
UNDEAD and NIGHTHAUNT WIZARDS can

attempt
to cast Summon Vault of Souls. It has
a casting value of 6. If successfully cast, set up
a Vault of Souls model wholly within 18" of
the caster.

PREDATORY: Vault of Souls is a predatory
endless spell. It can move 8" and can fly.

ABILITIES

Soul Siphon: As the eerie Vault of Souls passes
overhead,
it draws the life-essence of those nearby
into itself to lethal effect.

After this model is set up or has moved, roll a
dice for each model within 6" of it. On a 6+, that
model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

Soul Eruption: Should a Vault of Souls glut itself
too greedily,
the captured spirits within will burst
free, tearing at those nearby in their desperation
to escape.

Keep track of the number of mortal wounds
inflicted by this model. If the total is 20 or more
at the end of any phase, all units within 6" of this
model suffer D6 mortal wounds, and then this
model is dispelled.

Empowered by Shyish: The temporal dominion

of a Mor talis Terminexus
is greatly augmented
within the Realm of Death.

If your battle is being fought in the Realm of

Mortality ability – whether the controlling player
chose to reverse or hasten time – is 12" instead
of 6".

DESCRIPTION

Mortalis Terminexus is a single model.

Summon Mortalis Terminexus: A spectral

shape, promising temporal grace or doom to
mor tal and immortal alike.

Only NAGASH, SUPREME LORD OF THE

ABILITIES

Keeper of Mortality : A Mor talis Terminexus

The table below provides points, minimum unit sizes and battlefield roles for the warscrolls and warscroll
battalions in this book, for use in Pitched Battles. Spending the points listed on this table allows you to take a
minimum-sized unit with any of its upgrades. Understrength units cost the fu l l amount of points. Larger units
are taken in multiples of their minimum unit size; multiply their cost by the same amount as you multiplied their
size. If a unit has two points values separated by a slash (e.g. ‘60/200’), the second value is for a maximum-sized
unit. Units that are listed as ‘Unique’ are named characters and can only be taken once in an army. A unit that
