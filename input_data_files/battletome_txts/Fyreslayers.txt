Many civilisations thrived during the Age of
Myth, but not so the Fyreslayers. Their god,
Grimnir,
the duardin deity of battle, was lost to
them in an epic confrontation. Grimnir’s form
was shattered,
intermingling with the molten
blood of his monstrous slain foe, Vulcatrix, and
cast on winds of fire to scatter across all
the
Mortal Realms. For his followers, nothing would
ever be the same.

Then came the Age of Chaos, an era that broke
cultures apart as the minions of the Dark Gods
invaded. The Great Alliance collapsed, Sigmar
the God-King retreated to the Heavens, and
everywhere the legions of Chaos established
cruel dominion. One force alone stood strong.
They did not hide,
for they were made to
be tested in battle. And that
is what
the
Fyreslayers sought, marching forth to war as
often as they could, hiring themselves out as
mercenaries to any who had gold to pay them.

From the magmaholds of Aqshy the Fyreslayers
spread, hewing out their own kingdoms and
hoarding vast quantities of treasure. Though
they were constantly besieged, no foe could
penetrate their volcanic sanctums. They were
without allies,
for even those that hired
them scorned them as greedy sellswords.
Misunderstood, mistrusted;
to the Fyreslayers
it mattered not,
for there was a secret hidden
in the gold they so aggressively gathered. With
every battle,
their furtive and unspoken hope
came closer to fruition.

When Sigmar re-opened the Heavens and sent
forth his Stormcast Eternals,
they found that
Chaos had overrun all save the Fyreslayers.
Indeed, during that
terrible age they had
proliferated. And by flame and fury will
they
continue to do so, until
their final victory,
for
such is the binding oath they made to Grimnir.

A PATH OF BLOOD, GOLD
AND FIRE

A PATH OF BLOOD,
GOLD AND FIRE

From flame-filled holds and deep mountain vaults, the Fyreslayers march out to war. Brash and unforgiving, they
charge into battle shouting fierce war cries and wielding finely honed axes, the power of the mighty warrior-god
Grimnir flowing into them from glittering golden runes hammered into their ruddy flesh.

Fyreslayers are duardin dedicated
to the fallen god Grimnir. They are
harsh, aggressive and possessed of
blazing temperaments, prone to
sudden eruptions of violence. As a
race, the Fyreslayers are obsessed
with two things: war and gold.

Fyreslayers are renowned warriors,
and their ferocity is famed
throughout the Mortal Realms. They
are more than just restless fighters,
however,
for to them battle is a vital
aspect of their religion. They always
feel the need to be at war, and if they
cannot find any of their own enemies
to fight, they wi l l seek the conflicts
of others. Fyreslayers are eager
mercenaries, and they fight for any
with gold enough to meet their fee.

To outside observers the Fyreslayers
seem little more than money-
grubbing sellswords, yet their
battlefield triumphs ensure their
services are always in demand. From
kings to councils of tribal elders,
many seek out the hot-blooded
duardin to enlist their services.
With their constant warring the
Fyreslayers have garnered enemies
beyond count, and while they have
many customers, their belligerent
ways ensure they have few true allies.

A DIFFERENT KIND
OF DUARDIN

The Fyreslayers exhibit many of the
traits that duardin are famed for,
including stubbornness, deference

to age, taking umbrage at the least
offense, and believing matters
of oaths and honour to be of the
utmost import. Yet
there is much
that is unique about the Fyreslayers,
qualities far different to those of
their ancestral kin.

The duardin of old were famed
for their craftsmanship. They
were mighty toilers that dedicated
much of their lives to car ving
out homesteads deep beneath the
mountains, excavating mines in
search of precious metals and
refining the arts of metallurgy and
forging. At need, those duardin put
aside their occupations and took
up arms in order to fight those that
threatened their homes, but always

To outsiders, perhaps the strangest
habit of the Fyreslayers is their
practice of pressing metal into
their flesh, for each bears runes of
gold that are literally hammered
red-hot into their bodies. In battle
these sigils glow, radiating heat
and light as if they were just pulled
from the forge. The strongest
of their number – with massive
crests of hair and thickly corded
muscles – are so studded with such
runes that they too begin to glow,
beards blazing, and cinders drifting
from their smouldering skin. In
their battle-rage the Fyreslayers go
berserk, undaunted by the size or
number of their foes and wading
into the enemy’s midst with axes
swinging, their voices raised to issue
war-songs, coarse insults or barely
coherent oaths to Grimnir.

After battle the Fyreslayers collect
their fallen and any payment due,
then return to their stronghold. This
is most often a magmahold beneath
the mountains, though some operate
out of forge-temples established in
the larger cities of Order.

When not caught up in their
emotions, Fyreslayers are pragmatic.
They care little for politics, and are
isolationists with scant empathy for

the plight of others. Their concerns
centre around fu lfi l ling their own
oaths, which usually boils down to
acquiring gold by any means. Other
races assume that the Fyreslayers
are simply greedy, with an insatiable
need to stockpile the precious
metal. Would-be allies often grow
quickly estranged as they witness
Fyreslayers fighting alongside them
one day and then against them the
next. Across the Mortal Realms it
is common enough to hear many
call the fiery duardin unscrupulous
warmongers, disloyal sellswords
that are only too ready to fight
alongside traitors, monsters or even
worshippers of the Dark Gods.

There is truth in such claims, for
Fyreslayers do seek war and eagerly
fight as mercenaries. And some of
their kind have accepted coin from
the most unsavoury of sources.
However,
the fu l l reasoning behind
their actions is known only by the
Fyreslayers themselves, for gold and
battle are intrinsically connected
to their lost deity. The duardin do
nothing to halt the dissemination
of even the most base accusations
of avarice, for others would be less
likely to part with their gold if they
knew the true power held within its
gleaming lustre.

KEEPERS OF THE KEYS

There are several reoccurring symbols important to the Fyreslayers, but
none more so than the key. Most obviously,
it represents their people’s
ancestral ties to Aqshy, where it is commonly associated with the magic
of that realm. However,
the key holds even deeper significance for
the Fyreslayers. First and foremost,
it reminds them of their binding
covenant with Grimnir. To the Zharrgrim priests, it has a further,
hidden meaning; the key represents their order’s secret quest, for it
symbolises freedom from a state of constraint. Members of the order
are given forge keys, each crafted from different metals to designate
their progress within the priesthood, with gold used for those with the
highest experience. Of course, Fyreslayers being duardin and therefore
a no-nonsense sort of folk, the keys they bear also serve a practical
purpose. Those carried by Runefathers and Runemasters unlock the
mighty doors of their forge-temple, as well as the magma-vault where
the lodge’s ultimate treasures are stored.

when danger passed the majority
went back to their true vocations.

Such is not the way of the followers
of Grimnir. Like their kindred,
the Fyreslayers too are expert
miners and blacksmiths, and they
also fashion their homes beneath
mountains, yet their attitude to
such labours differs greatly. To the
Fyreslayers, there is but a single
worthy profession: war. All their
efforts and creations are ultimately
devoted towards that endeavour.

ORIGINS OF
THE FYRESLAYERS

Fyreslayers first appeared in Aqshy,
the Realm of Fire, and have long
since spread to every Mortal Realm.
During the Age of Myth they were
the first to follow Grimnir,
the
duardin god of battle, though tales
of their origins differ. Some claim
that the Fyreslayers’
forebears were
Grimnir’s children, others that
the god made them out of his own
incandescent rage. No few myths
recount how the duardin factions
each chose their own patron from
amongst their pantheon. However
their people came about, the
Fyreslayers were, and always have
been, wholly dedicated to Grimnir.

Since their appearance during
the Age of Myth, Fyreslayers have
eschewed bulky armour. Indeed,
they wear little more than a beard,
helmet,
loincloth and girdle. It
takes great boldness to charge
bare-chested into combat, but like
their patron, Fyreslayers believe
they are protected by their own
fiery convictions.

Another way in which the
Fyreslayers emulate Grimnir is the
distinctive hairstyle they adopt. A
vital aspect of their warrior-cult, a
Fyreslayer’s
locks are shorn on the
sides, while the hair on top is spiked
high into an impressive crest. It is
dyed, and held in place by a waxy
substance, each lodge maintaining
and jealously guarding their own
secret concoctions for such purposes.
Those who mock a Fyreslayer’s hair
do so only once, for the misguided
fool’s head is swiftly separated from
their neck.


PAGEBREAK
In battle, Fyreslayers unleash the pent-up might of their fallen god. Blazing with berserk fury, the doughty warriors
fearlessly charge even vast monsters or the most heavily armoured of foes. Each fights with the fiery conviction of
Grimnir himself, who once said, ‘There is no foe that my axe cannot bring down to size.’

THE FALL OF GRIMNIR

THE FALL OF GRIMNIR

8

Nothing has affected the Fyreslayers more than the death of their patron, Grimnir, the duardin god of battle. The
ramifications of that tragic loss have not only brought about the Fyreslayers’ continuing purpose, but also inspire
their zeal, empower their battle prowess, and heavily influence their fatalistic hope for the future.

Long before the ending of the world-
that-was, Grimnir had sung his
death-song. He had ventured alone
into the Northlands seeking to close
the polar gates that spewed forth
Chaos and allowed the minions and
warping power of the Dark Gods to
pour forth into reality.

During his journeys, Grimnir’s
battles, deeds of valour, and tests
of wi l l were beyond count. Lost
and bewildered by the insanity
of the realm he had been drawn
into, Grimnir did not complete his

DEATH RITES

Burial rites are important to
the Fyreslayers. The omission
of such time-honoured rituals
is deemed an insult, for
they hold that it jeopardises
reincarnation. Fyreslayers
believe that their deceased
must be cremated, for only then
can they properly rejoin their
revered ancestors and return to
stone, metal, earth and fire, for
of such elements were they first
forged. The spark of their being
(what some races term the soul)
is extinguished, a process they
compare to the burning of coal,
which glows bright for a time
but is reduced to ash in the
end. The Fyreslayers’ outlook
in this regard is more practical
than nihilistic, as they believe
death is not the ultimate end.
The duardin gods know the
secrets of how to wake them
from stone-sleep, and how to
reforge them. Before Doomgron
– the final battle – they wi l l be
remade. In council with the
gods, the ancestors wi l l judge
who is worthy, reincarnating
each in the order in which they
first walked the realms. Those
not given the proper funeral
rites, or those found wanting,
might never be remade.

mission. However, such was his fiery
determination and indefatigable
strength that he was neither slain nor
driven mad in the attempt.

was the duardin god’s desire that
Sigmar should name a mighty enemy
for him to slay single-handedly, and
thereby fulfil his vow.

How long Grimnir wandered is
unknown, for time has no meaning
in the Realm of Chaos. Yet his tale
truly begins after the destruction of
the world-that-was, at the dawning
of the Age of Myth. During that time
of legends, the gods first discovered
and walked amongst the Mortal
Realms. And so it was with Grimnir,
who one day awoke in Aqshy and
found himself surrounded by his
kin. Although weak and wearied
from his dreadful
journey, Grimnir
recognised the duardin that attended
him, and he rejoiced to be back in
the lands of mortals.

Despite his long plight, Grimnir
sought to serve those who had
revived him. He listened to their
pleas and acted on them, hunting
down and catching the godbeast
Ignax, whom he shackled to the
Land of the Chained Sun so that all
might have light and fire.

Even as he rested from his task,
another evil befell the duardin gods.
Exactly what occurred during the
event known as the Thagduegi – the
Great Betrayal – is unclear, but the
duardin pantheon broke apart. In
the aftermath of traitorous acts,
Grimnir and his brother Grungni
were left shackled atop the tallest
of the Iron Mountains of Chamon.
There, bound in chains, the two
might have stayed forever had not
Sigmar – mankind’s celestial war-
god – stumbled upon them.

When Sigmar loosened their heavy
manacles, the duardin gods were
freed. Both pledged oaths to repay
the favour, but hot-headed Grimnir
demanded he be allowed to settle the
debt immediately. A rage had built
up in Grimnir during his captivity,
and he needed to release it before
the blazing anger overcame him. It

Sigmar greatly valued the duardin
gods, for they had been steadfast
allies in the past. Yet he knew also
that to name an unworthy target
would do great harm, for Grimnir
was riled easily, and prideful over
such matters. Acting impulsively,
Sigmar named the godbeast that he
himself thought would be the most
difficult to conquer – a decision he
immediately regretted.

BATTLE OF GOD
AND GODBEAST

So it was that the legendary duardin
sought out Vulcatrix, Mother of
Salamanders, she who first birthed
flame into the worlds.

There are several tales that recount
the last thing Grimnir did before
setting out. Some say he downed a
keg of ale, proclaiming it had to have
been brewed by one of the legendary
family of Bugman. Others tell of how
he bid his brother Grungni to forge
him a new axe for the monumental
task, while those of the Vostarg lodge
claim Grimnir helped choose the
site of their original magmahold
before embarking on his quest. All
versions agree that it was not long
before Grimnir strode into the
Hills of Aqshy searching for his
quarry. Grimnir went alone, but
he did not go quietly, booming out
his challenge every few strides, and
hurling coarse speculations about his
opponent’s
lineage.

When at last Grimnir came before
Vulcatrix, she uncoiled endlessly like
a molten river from between smoke-
belching peaks. Gleaming blade
and burning fang met in showers
of sparks, each blazing ember from
those mighty strikes outshining the
stars themselves as god sought to
best monster.

The Fyreslayers tell that it was
Vulcatrix’s
spite which claimed
Grimnir’s life, for he delivered a
mortal blow to his enemy but was
felled by her death throes and the
poisons that erupted from her rent
form. So great was the heat released
by the duel’s climax that a cataclysm
followed: a fiery blast of noxious
gases levelled mountains and created
the Plains of Aqshy. The scorching
of the lands, however, cleansed them
of the foul sulphurous dusts that
had once rendered them barren.
Elsewhere, the falling embers formed
the volcano Vostargi Mont, and
dozens more across the realms.

The nova-like event ignited the
magics of Aqshy, and the impossible
heat alloyed the divine spirit of
Grimnir with the Great Salamander’s
blood of liquid metal. God and
godbeast were intertwined, and
scattered far. Flaming ruin streaked
across the skies, blazing like meteors
to fall across the realms, while all
across Aqshy volcanoes answered the
outburst with eruptions like some
final tribute.

UR-GOLD AND
MAGMADROTH EGGS

Where they landed, the fragments of
Grimnir and Vulcatrix had a strange
effect upon the lands. The divine
remnants writhed and twisted,
bur ying themselves underground,
where they fused with veins of gold.
The resultant substance looked to all
appearances like ordinary gold, but it
had been transmuted into something
much more. Only the Fyreslayers
proved able to detect this new metal,
which they called ur-gold – an ability
of which they do not openly speak.

Since their discovery of what
ur-gold was and what it could
do, the Fyreslayers have been a
race possessed. To outsiders, they
seem little more than common
mercenaries, warring for bullion.

Yet
in truth, Fyreslayers do not seek
treasure for its own sake, nor for
what it can buy them; the holds and
weapons a lodge owns are all crafted
by the toil of their own people.
They hire out their services simply
as a means to reclaim the scattered
remains of their broken god, and
even the smallest trace of ur-gold
is precious beyond measure. For a
Fyreslayer,
the gathering of ur-gold
and the subsequent release of its
powers in battle is nothing short of
a religious act. It not only brings the
Fyreslayers closer to their god, but
it frees Grimnir’s entrapped spirit.
If they could release the energies of
enough of the shattered fragments,
they would ensure Grimnir’s rebirth
for the final battle, the Doomgron.

The creation of ur-gold was not
the only strange after-effect of the
titanic battle between Vulcatrix
and Grimnir. In some flamestruck
regions, black spheres were formed,
the scorching-hot eggs that would
one day give birth to Magmadroths,
the offspring of the Great
Salamander herself.

MAGMAHOLDS

MAGMAHOLDS

Fyreslayers construct vast subterranean fortresses hewn from the stony hearts of mountains. These nigh-
impregnable underground cities are known as magmaholds, and it is from their imposing gates the Fyreslayer
armies march forth seeking war and gold.

After Grimnir’s destruction, the
god’s followers made their home
in Aqshy. Here, along the vast
volcanic mountain range known
as the Salamander’s Spine, the
first magmaholds were created.
These were similar to karaks,
the underground strongholds of
other duardin, but there was one
essential difference: the Fyreslayers
chose exclusively to carve their
underground passageways beneath
active volcanoes.

As the Fyreslayers became
more familiar with the volatile
environments in which they dwelt,
they achieved greater and greater
feats of engineering and stonecraft.
Eventually they learned to channel
rivers of magma, using the molten
rock to bore new tunnels, or to form
defensive barriers through which no
foe could pass.

It has been many ages since
outsiders have been allowed to enter
a magmahold, for the Fyreslayers
have grown ever more gruff and
isolationist. In the Age of Myth
– before the Fyreslayers were so
guarded – some few did pass beyond
the gates of such a fastness to
describe what they saw there. Dark
passages gave way to high arched
chambers and many-pillared halls.
It was said the architecture lacked
some of the ar tisana l flair of the
stonework that marked the duardin
karaks, yet they were still works
far beyond the most sk i lfu l human
engineers. Even then, however,
it
was apparent that the Fyreslayers
would rather carve foes than rock
– such tasks were to be completed,
and completed well, but it was not
anyone’s
life work. There was one
area in which magmaholds bested
karaks however, and that was in the
hoarding of treasure.

Magmaholds were quickly filled
with gold as the scions of Grimnir
sought traces of their lost god. Most

of the precious metal contained
little or none of the divine spirit of
Grimnir, and even that which did
was soon drained. The by-product of
ur-gold is simply gold, a substance
that swiftly accumulated within the
magmaholds. Thus, even the poorest
Fyreslayer cities could boast vast
ancestor-statues and rune-etched
masks forged from solid gold, as well
as columns that stretched out of sight
bearing countless gilded braziers,
which cast a brilliant gleam upon
ever ything beneath them.

Doubtless it was the Fyreslayers’
riches – and the many enemies they
made due to their mercenary ways –
that drew invaders to their holdings.
Not all the attacks were raids made
in the name of plunder, however,
for the Age of Chaos was dawning,
and it was swiftly transforming into
an era of terror. Wave after wave
of assailants attacked civilisations
across the Mortal Realms.
Corruption, mutation, and plague
were rampant.

One by one the karaks were broken
and the duardin driven out of their
mountain holds. Enemies were
everywhere – skaven and grots
tunnelled from below, many tribes of
men were corrupted and turned into
blood-crazed killers that rampaged
across the plains, beastmen stormed
out of the forests, and daemon
armies scoured the lands. Once
driven out of their mountain
dwellings, the duardin refugees were
little more than prey for creatures
such as troggoths, gargants, and
other monsters that stalked the
lands. It was a time of disaster for the
duardin, save only in Aqshy, where
the magmaholds of the Fyreslayers
held strong.

Aided by their molten defences,
Fyreslayer holds proved tough
nuts for the Chaos forces to crack.
It was significant also that all
the Fyreslayers were followers of
Grimnir,
that is to say, they were
warriors first and foremost. Invasion
after invasion was repelled. A few
magmaholds were breached and
destroyed, but these were the smaller
ones. Only when the followers of the
Dark Gods turned to subterfuge did
they meet with real success. Chaos
forces, disguised as refugees from
fallen kingdoms, were allowed to
enter. Their targets were no longer
the impenetrable walls of the
magmaholds themselves, but the
societies within: the lodges.

FYRESLAYER LODGES

A lodge is a group of Fyreslayer
families or households, the chieftains
of which claim descent from a
common ancestor. Magmaholds
are typically settled by one lodge,
although there are instances of two
or more co-existing within the same
magmahold. Typically,
lodges that
share holds are closely related, and
such situations tend to be temporary
until the newest branch grows large
and bold enough to establish their
own territory.

The earliest Fyreslayer lodges were
known as the first-forged, for they
were the duardin who walked in
the presence of Grimnir before
he embarked on his quest to slay
Vulcatrix. Those original
lodges no
longer exist, although some – such as
the Vostarg and the Greyfyrd – claim
to be their direct descendants.

Each lodge is formed around a
single patriarch, a leader known as
a Runefather. He and his family rule
the lodge, with authority passing
down to his male heirs, who are
known as Runesons. Each lodge also
maintains their own forge-temple
and Zharrgrim priesthood.

11

A Runefather who has many
Runesons must choose one to
succeed him. Those not chosen often
decide to set out with a few followers,
hoping to break away and establish a
new lodge. When a Runefather dies
with no declared heir,
it typically
marks the end of the lodge. The
remaining Fyreslayers must decide
to follow one of their own, pledge
themselves to another lodge, or take
the oath to become grimnyn – a
duardin word that means ‘fated
wanderer’, and is used by those
who have abandoned home and
hope. They roam the Mortal Realms
with the aim of meeting either new
purpose or death in battle. This is
similar to, but not as fatalistic as, the
vow of the Doomseeker.

To outsiders, Fyreslayers seem
to be a society wholly dominated
by males, for females are rarely
seen and the lodge rule is clearly
patrilineal, meaning that property
and title are inherited exclusively
by the sons. In truth, Fyreslayers
are as secretive about the women of
their kind as they are about ur-gold.
It is known that females are rare
amongst the Fyreslayers, born in
disproportionately low numbers.
The few that claim to have seen any
say they are every bit as hot-headed,
impetuous and battle-worthy as
their menfolk. Female Fyreslayers
are masters of the hearth, healing,
brewing and magmic defences.
Some privileged travellers tell of
Fyrequeens who hold mighty powers,
but of such things the warriors of the
fyrds wi l l not speak to members of
other races.

THE COST OF DEFENCE

During the Age of Chaos, the
magmaholds that survived did so
by closing their gates. Refugees of
broken civilisations,
including many
duardin from the karaks, sought
the safety of the magmaholds, but
were met only with silence as they
battered upon iron-bound gates.
Grim-faced and stoic, the Fyreslayers
admitted no one.

But even though the Fyreslayers
closed their gates to those seeking
sanctuary,
they still marched out
to bring war to the forces of Chaos.

Fyreslayer armies – known as fyrds
– emerged from secret tunnels at
will. Far from the magmaholds, new
passages opened up, filling once
more with lava in the wake of those
who traversed them. These armies
marched out into the Chaos-ridden
lands and sold their axes to the
highest bidders. Desperate tribes
or besieged cities paid exorbitant
prices in gold to the Fyreslayers. The
violence of the times meant there
was always a need for their services.

During this time of horror and
strife, the Fyreslayers multiplied and
prospered. Secure in their volcanic
homes and growing ever wealthier,
the burgeoning populations within
the magmaholds led to many splinter
groups striking out in hopes of
establishing their own domains. So
did the Fyreslayers spread all across
Aqshy, where they found the richest
deposits of ur-gold and Magmadroth
eggs. They followed ur-gold trails,
mercenary contracts and tales of
fortune into other lands until they
had established magmaholds in
every realm. Where possible they

gravitated towards volcanic regions,
but at need they tunnelled into living
mountains in Ghur, established
bases amongst the sky-islands of
Chamon, and hollowed out cairn
peaks in Shyish. All continued to
amass gold,
largely through payment
for their employment as mercenaries,
but occasionally by seizing it from
foes, or even by mining.

Unbeknownst
to the Fyreslayers,
however,
they were not as immune
to the designs of Chaos worshippers
as they thought. Agents of Tzeentch,
the Great Conspirator, were quick
to whisper to the survivors of fallen
kingdoms, reminding them not to
forget who refused to open their
gates to them in their darkest hour.
Tales of the Fyreslayers’ mercenary
ways were often stretched, and
even those who successfully hired
them were bewitched into believing
themselves ill-used by greedy
duardin. The Plague God Nurgle
invented a new pox, one that clung to
a single substance: gold. If touched,
infected metal drove mortals to
distraction, so much so that they
would ki l l one another to possess
it. All races that coveted gold were
susceptible to the disease, and its
grip on Fyreslayers, who already
suffered from the glimmerlust,
proved especially deadly. Several
previously impregnable magmaholds
were torn apart internally as
the lodges that dwelt within
became corrupted.

AIR AND FIRE

The ancestors of the Fyreslayers and Kharadron Overlords were related,
and once lived side by side, but their descendants have diverged. In the
Age of Myth, the Fyreslayers’
forebears swore themselves to Grimnir,
while those of the karaks took Grungni as their patron. After the fall of
their mountain holds and the refusal of the Fyreslayers to take them in,
refugees from the shattered karaks took to the skies, evolving into the
Kharadron Overlords. They never again looked upon the Fyreslayers
as kin, but only as trade partners that would likely hold to their end
of an oath. For their part, most Fyreslayer lodges lost touch with the
Overlords, and see them now less as distant relations and more as rich
customers. The fact that most of the Kharadron have abandoned the
gods – for they themselves felt abandoned by their pantheon – sits
poorly with the zealous Fyreslayers. Each side, being duardin, and
therefore cantankerous at the best of times, is contemptuous of the
other. Open conflict is rare but not unheard of, save amongst the
Granthium Mountains in Chamon, where ur- and aether-gold have
mixed and each side strives to claim the entire deposit as their own.

Heart of the Hold

HEART OF THE HOLD

12

At the centre of each magmahold is its forge-temple, a sanctuar y where the Zharrgrim priesthood safeguard the
lodge’s ur-gold and fashion it into powerful runes. Through their fiery hammer-blows is Grimnir’s fighting spirit
brought back to blazing life, and the power of the Fyreslayers made manifest.

Hidden deep beneath shimmering
mountains and behind graven stone
doors are the forge-temples of the
Fyreslayers. Here are the beating
hearts of the magmaholds, their
pulse pounded out by the ceaseless
clang of hammers. The vast halls
echo and throb to that heavy
rhythm, punctuated by the grinding
wail of axes being sharpened. The
air ripples, and all glows red from
the heat of the forgebanks and
rivers of lava that flow through the
surrounding chambers to power
them. Sparks fly everywhere, and
the heat is enough to make an ogor’s
eyeballs sizzle.

The forges of the Fyreslayers’
ancestors were akin to those of
other duardin, constructs built from
designs taught to them by Grungni.
Upon Grimnir’s shattering, however,
the firestorm that swept the realms
ignited something inside the forges
of those in Aqshy who had dedicated
themselves to the god of battle. This
was known as the Zharrkhul, the
Master Flame or First Fire. Those
who tended this divine spark and
stoked the supernatural flames
became known as the Zharrgrim, the
priests of the undying fire.

To this day the Zharrgrim
priesthood lead the lodges in the
worship of Grimnir. Though all
Fyreslayers have some sense of
ur-gold, only an Auric Runemaster
– an elder steeped in the sacred
lore of metallurgy, fire and the
spirit of battle – can definitively
pick out metal imbued with
Grimnir’s essence from its mundane
counterpart. It is the Runemaster
who leads the process of extraction,
where flames and heat are used to
smelt the alloy so that the ur-gold
can be separated in its purest
form. The ur-gold is then cast into
sacred runes, the great majority of
which signify some aspect of battle,
such as strength, fury, endurance,
indomitable boldness,
loyalty to kin,
or Grimnir himself.

In a process that is every bit
as agonising as it sounds, the
Runemaster then pounds the ur-gold
sigils into the bodies of Fyreslayer
warriors. It is essential to perform
this act with the runes still glowing
hot from the forge, for only in this
way can the rune truly fuse into the
duardin’s muscular frame.

A Fyreslayer with ur-gold hammered
into his flesh immediately feels a
greater connection to his god, but
it is not until the runes are awoken
in battle that they unleash their
true power. It is the duty of another
branch of the Zharrgrim priests
to rouse the runes’
latent might.
These Runesmiters accompany
the warriors to battle, their ritual
chanting igniting the runes and
unlocking the battle-rage of Grimnir
himself. The glowing sigils augment
the Fyreslayers’ physical might and
martial prowess, raising them to
supernatural
levels.

RISING POWER

The first followers of Grimnir
to discover ur-gold knew it was
somehow connected to their
fallen god, but not how. In time,
masterwork weapons were created
using the metal, for the Fyreslayers
have always been skilled artisans.
Yet
these objects could only impart
a small measure of power to their
wielders. It was only when the first
Runemasters forged the gold into
runes for warriors to wear into battle
that the true potential of ur-gold
was glimpsed.

Blazing white-hot, these tokens
burned their way into the flesh of
the Fyreslayers, sending them into a

Grimnir-blessed fighting frenzy that
saw countless enemies cut down.
Eventually,
the ur-gold runes were
hammered directly into a warrior’s
body, where their divine energies
could better take root.

Over time, the Zharrgrim priests
learned to unlock more of the
secret properties of ur-gold. That
Grimnir’s shattered being fuelled
rage and a fiery spirit was considered
only proper, but as the Zharrgrim
priests learned to control flame
and summon elemental energies,
they realised that the ur-gold
contained more than the essence
of their god alone. The fragments
were discovered to be specks of
Grimnir’s quintessence intertwined
with that of Vulcatrix,
fused by
impossible heat. No longer battling,
the two kindred spirits had bonded,
becoming stronger together.

It was the Zharrgrim priests who
first found Magmadroth eggs and
learned how to raise the creatures.
Where long ago the beasts had been
the mortal enemies of any who dared
invade their volcanic sanctums,
they have since bonded with the
Fyreslayers. It is wrong to think of
Magmadroths as domesticated, for
the creatures are far too wi lfu l; they
are more akin to allies of the duardin
than mere beasts of burden.

The secrets of ur-gold are in
many ways still a mystery to the
Fyreslayers, and the Zharrgrim
priests are still
learning of its divine
power. The Shyish necroquake,
which flooded all the realms
with tides of magical energy, has
boosted the elemental powers of the
Zharrgrim, and their war-chants can
now summon new and more potent
magmic manifestations. In addition
to magma-tunnelling and calling up
molten rock from the deep places,
Zharrgrim priests can raise Magmic
Battleforges to ignite the Fyreslayers’
war-spirit, or summon Infernoths
and Runic Fyrewalls.

THE GLIMMERLUST

Ur-gold is a finite resource, for
its power is released in battle as a
Fyreslayer fights. To maintain his
might, a Fyreslayer must constantly
have fresh runes struck into his
body. This can leave the duardin
craving more should he feel the
divine strength of Grimnir leaving
him, and this hunger only adds to
the many legends told by other races
of the Fyreslayers’ avarice.

‘With each strike of

the hammer,

You are tested with pain,

The runes shall

ignite your rage,

And fury shall be your armour.’

- Hammerchant of Runemaster Althar

It is in this field that the Zharrgrim
priests perform another vital duty,
steering the members of the lodge
safely along the path of Grimnir.
The Runemasters in particular have
learned to temper the Fyreslayers’
impulsive natures; even the Auric
Runefathers, the lords of the lodges,
seek the counsel and wisdom of the
Zharrgrim elders in this regard. It
is for the Runemasters to guide the
Fyreslayers, and protect their people
against the perils of gold-greed. They
ensure that ur-gold is given only to
those deserving of its blessing, and
that no warrior is given more than
his rightful due or, for that matter,
more than he can bear. Should this
happen, the consequences can be
dire indeed.

ROGUE SLAYERS

Alone, and without the wisdom
of the Zharrgrim priests to guide
him, a duardin might be completely
consumed by the glimmerlust.
Grim tales are told of lone warriors
overcome by their need for ur-
gold. This is sometimes the fate of
Doomseekers, warriors who have
pledged to leave their lodge and
seek a mighty end. Many do so
heroically, but no few have gone
mad, such as the Axe of Magorth or
the Immolated Slayer. These reviled
beings are called Doomvarags,
and they are rabid lone wolves that
would even ki l l other Fyreslayers
so they might prise the runes from
their remains.

BORN OF FLAME

BORN OF FLAME

14

The Realm of Aqshy is where the Fyreslayers have their origins, and to many is where they most belong. It is a
volatile land, and its people are known for their fiery passions and fervent causes. It is here where the roots of the
Fyreslayers lie, buried amidst the volcanic mountain ranges, cracked earth and flame-ridden plains.

Also known as the Bright Realm and
the Realm of Fire, Aqshy is made up
of dozens of different continents.
Once, these were all accessible to
one another, connected by bodies
of water, but they have since been
fractured. Some lands were blasted
apart by the battle of Grimnir and
Vulcatrix, and even more were
broken up by the ruinous energies
released during the Age of Chaos.
Now it is nearly impossible to reach
the different landmasses without
the use of Realmgates. Despite the
size of the realm and its multitude of
dangers, the fyrds of the Fyreslayers
have scoured every corner of its
lands searching for traces of ur-gold.

The Fyreslayers originally hail from
Aqshy, and have since spread to all
the realms. It is still in the Realm
of Fire, however, where their flames
burn brightest. Even after long
ages, more Fyreslayer lodges can
be found in Aqshy than any other
realm. The reason for this is simple:
there are more ur-gold deposits and
Magmadroth eggs to be found in the
Realm of Fire than anywhere else.

THE FIRST-FORGED

The earliest Fyreslayer settlements
were founded along the vast
mountain range known as the
Salamander’s Spine. Accounts of how
many holds were established there
differ ; however,
the volatile nature of
the region’s volcanoes has changed
much of its landscape, meaning there
is no way to verify any such claim.
All of the forefathers of the current
lodges came from this region, and
it was the forges of these holds that
roared to life with the supernatural
flames of the Zharrkhul, the
firestorm that raged over the skies of
Aqshy after Grimnir met his doom.

Once the epicentre of Fyreslayer
culture, the Salamander’s Spine is
now a desolate place. Most of the
original magmaholds have been
destroyed, and the few that remain

have been ransacked many times.
In spite of this historic decline, it is
common for the lands and empires
of Aqshy to remake themselves,
starting anew after being swept
clear by fire. So it proved for the
Fyreslayers, although their legends
tell many tales of the Salamander’s
Spine and the lodges that began it a l l.

VOSFORGE

The original Vostarg lodge lived in
Vosforge,
largest of the magmaholds
carved into the Salamander’s Spine.
More lodges have sprung from that
one mighty bloodline than any
other of the first-forged. Hundreds
of current lodges can trace their
heritage directly back to those
who came from that vast fortress.
Today,
the lodge that still bears the
Vostarg name has made its home in
Furios Peak, the largest volcano in
the Cynder Peaks mountain range.
The magmahold was founded by
Urgom-Grimnir,
the first to climb
the Thousand Stairs and lay pick to
stone where it now stands.

THE HARRWORLD

Of the place of the Greyfyrd’s
origins, the Harrworld, nothing
is ever said. The mountain that
stood over the halls of the first of
their line, the Greygrend, has been
levelled. Nearly all lodges that have
suffered disproportionately from the
glimmerlust can trace their roots to
the Greygrend, but these duardin do
not speak of their troubled heritage.

The Greyfyrd still maintain holds
in Aqshy,
including Asharak in
the Bright Mountains and the
Emberhalls in the Caustic Peaks,
near the city of Hammerhal Aqsha.
Their fastness on the Scarred Isle,
however, was destroyed by Archaon
during the Realmgate Wars. All of
these locations are connected by the
firepaths, portals that lead back to
the Greyfyrd’s capital, the Gateswold
in Chamon.

KARADRUM

While natural disasters and civil
strife claimed some of the first-
forged,
it was the armies of Chaos
that destroyed the Grymdar. Their
hold of Karadrum was taken and
the lodge’s Runefather slain. The
refugees that escaped chose a new
leader, and became the Hermdar
lodge. Taking vows of vengeance,
they stormed back to reclaim what
had been their hold, freeing the
captives therein from a terrible
fate. Yet
the mountainside had
been riven beyond repair by the
ferocity of the fighting, and so the
remaining Zharrgrim priests caused
the volcano to erupt, bur ying the
underhalls in waves of lava.

The Hermdar have remained in
Aqshy ever since, establishing a
new magmahold, the Grymhold,
beneath the highest mountain

BRIGHT MAGIC

The Realm of Fire has always
been rich in bright magic, the
energies harnessed in the art
of pyromancy.
In general it
can be said that the intensity
and power of a realm’s native
magic increases at its edge,
and grows fainter the fur ther
inland one travels. However,
the eldritch energies in Aqshy
can be fickle. At times they
blow strong like the hot wind
that races before a firestorm; at
other times they lull, as rare as
water in the Parchlands. That
a l l changed with the Shyish
necroquake. The event not only
increased the concentration
and potency of death magic in
the realms, but a l l sorcerous
energies. For the Zharrgr im
priests, this meant the star t of
a new era, for their ability to
summon and control magmic
elemental powers has since
increased tenfold.

in the Adamantine Chain. From
there they continue to sell their
martial services, most especially
to the human tribes of the
Flamescar Plateau.

DRAKENHAL

The first-forged known as the
Drakendreng lodge were famous
for their monster-slaying skills.
Emulating Grimnir,
they hunted the
largest and most ferocious beasts
they could find, and lined the gates
of their magmahold, Drakenhal,
with their quarry’s skulls. Perhaps
it was this, or the rumoured size
of their fabled treasure hoard, that
drew Nagwroth the fyre serpent.
Offspring of the titanic godbeast
Nagendra, Nagwroth coiled around
the mountain, and the ensuing battle
destroyed Drakenhal.

During that great catastrophe, the
Drakendreng’s
ruling dynasty was
severed, and the survivors founded
the Lofnir lodge. They left the ruins
of their old home and pursued the
wounded Nagwroth all the way
to Ghur. There they established a
new magmahold, Rufhal, within
the domed volcano of Crownpeak.
Since then, they have sought to fulfil
the oaths of vengeance that their
ancestors swore against Nagwroth.

OTHER KEY LOCATIONS

Vostargi Mont is a huge volcano that
rises from the Flamescar Plateau. It
was formed from the falling debris
created by Grimnir’s battle with
Vulcatrix. Many Fyreslayers have
mined the mountain, and the current
stronghold is open to all lodges but
ruled by the Vostarg. It is to this site
that many humans made their way
during the Age of Chaos, desperate to
hire the skills of the Fyreslayers.

The Cynder Peaks mountain range is
perhaps the most volcanically active
in Aqshy.
Its constant eruptions
bring up and spit out much that has
long been buried deep. Many lodges
watch where these fireballs land, for
they leave craters rich in ur-gold, as
well as shiny clusters of Magmadroth
eggs. As the largest of the lodges, the
Vostarg have claimed this lucrative
region as their own.


PAGEBREAK
Vostarg

VOSTARG

16

The Vostarg are the only Fyreslayer lodge that still carr y the name of one of the first-forged lodges, who breathed
the same scorched air as Grimnir himself. Heavy with pride in their legacy and traditions, the Vostarg strive with
unmatched aggression to not only equal the deeds of their storied ancestors, but to surpass them.

Beneath the smouldering volcanoes
of the Cynder Peaks, the hammers
of the Vostarg lodge ring ceaselessly
upon their anvils like the drums
of war. Amongst the oldest of the
Aqshy Fyreslayer lodges, the Vostarg
can trace their lineage back to the
legendary Vosforge. From their
sprawling magmahold of Furios
Peak, the might of the Vostarg casts
a blazing glow across the lands. Their
reputation as brutal mercenaries
and fearsome warriors stretches far
beyond the borders of their domain.

The Vosforge was the largest of the
first-forged magmaholds and the last
of the original holds to fall. It held
out against enemy sieges during the
Age of Chaos, fighting off countless
armies of the Dark Gods. Each time
the foe stormed the gates the duardin
hurled them back, bloody and
broken onto the scorched plains. But
always the enemy returned.

In the end the Vosforge was undone
by avarice and discord rather than
by the foe. Its last Runefather,
Thorgar-Grimnir, broke a Chaos
assault by slaying the Bloodthirster
commander, but he soon fell of his
own wounds. Thorgar left behind
a dozen Runesons but no chosen
successor. Leaderless, the foe had
retreated,
leaving the magmahold
unassailed. Yet
the lodge had
no peace.

Each Runeson was convinced that
he alone deserved the inheritance.
With civil war about to erupt and
the Chaos forces beyond their gates

forming for another assault, the
Runemaster divided the lodge’s
ur-gold among the Runesons,
lest
infighting bring destruction to them
all. He bade them each to gather
followers and go their separate ways.
So it was that Vostarg were broken
and scattered across the realms
like Grimnir himself. The emptied
Vosforge was sacked many times
and became an abode of evil things.
Only one Runeson, Zhafor,
took
up the mantle of Vostarg, and his
descendants still drink to his honour
at every Ghuzfest.

The Vostarg are now the largest of
the Fyreslayer lodges. Aggressive
attack has always been their
hallmark, and their legacy of bold
triumphs is second to none. Down
the long ages they have been led to
greatness by a long line of successful,
and prolific, Runefathers. Indeed,
the Vostarg are sometimes referred

to as the All-fathers, for they have
produced more Runesons that have
marched out to found their own
kingdoms than any other lodge.
Their current leader, Bael-Grimnir,
has consummately maintained this
tradition, for he has sat on the ruby-
red Fyrethrone for centuries and has
fathered at least fifty sons.

It is not in the begetting of sons
alone that Bael-Grimnir has carved
out his legend. Over his long and
battle-filled career,
the Runefather’s
war-ventures have brought in
mountains of ur-gold. According to
the meticulous records recited by
the Battlesmiths, he trails only his
fabled ancestor Thorgar-Grimnir in
the acquisition of the Fyreslayers’
most precious substance. Such a holy
tribute to the duardin god of battle
commands great respect from the
other lodges, even those not related
to the long line of Vostarg.

Greyfyrd

GREYFYRD

Grim, fierce and for hire, the battle-hardened warriors of the Greyfyrd lodge are notorious mercenaries that
never say no to a mission, so long as their fee in gold is met. Amongst their number stride legends, for Greyfyrd
produces heroes the way active volcanoes produce smoke: frequently and in impressive volume.

17

The Greyfyrd are bold crusaders.
Their warriors can be found across
all the Mortal Realms, for their main
stronghold, the great Gateswold in
Chamon, contains many Realmgates.
At any one time there might be
a score of Greyfyrd armies out
campaigning across the realms.

With a reputation spread far and
wide, the warriors of Greyfyrd are
much sought after as mercenaries.
They have changed the fates of many
who have hired them, including
the Ninefold Kingdoms of Obsidia,
the Gloomtribes of Shyish and the
Neolantic Bloodlands. Their cost in
gold is high, but for those willing
to meet their demands there are no
questions. Over the centuries the
Greyfyrd have fought for, alongside
and against nearly every major
faction of the realms.

Most other lodges have a number
of caveats, qualms or stipulations
regarding the acceptance of certain
mercenary jobs. The Greyfyrd,
however, have only one: that their
price be met. In this manner they
have served countless paymasters,
joining wars just and unjust alike. In
the end, it is all the same to those of
Greyfyrd, for they care not for sides
or for causes save their own.

Those of Greyfyrd no longer mine,
and only the Zharrgrim priesthood
and those who would be Battlesmiths
still work the forges. It is war they
want, and it is a profession much
in demand. Such non-stop battling
ensures every Greyfyrd army is fu l l

of grizzled veterans. Many from
Greyfyrd are marked by their lives
of combat, their skin and muscles
thick with battle scars, while others
have lost an eye, or have missing
hands replaced with blades. Since
the Age of Myth countless fyrds
have marched in and out of the
Gateswold, either heading out to
war or returning home from one. It
is foretold by the lodge’s priests that
only when Grimnir returns wi l l the
Greyfyrd have rest and cease their
realm-spanning campaigns.

The Battlesmiths of Greyfyrd do
not speak of their lodge’s
troubled
heritage, the dark secrets of their
founders or the dubious deeds
of their kin. Instead, they spend
weeks recounting the sagas of each
Runefather since the infamous
Hurdar-Grimnir.
It was he who
held firm against the skaven tides
from the Verminvaults, and bested

a Bloodthirster single-handedly. The
chanting of the deeds of Grimwrath
Berzerker Asgeran, first of his kind,
takes longer still. And so it goes for
every era, with epic tales of lodge-
lords, priests and even warriors that
rose from the ranks to heroically
keep oaths, slay foes and collect gold.
Not all of Greyfyrd’s paragons are in
the distant past.

The current Runefather of the
Greyfyrd is Hursgar-Grimnir, a
great warrior who claims to have
slain every kind of creature that
walks, slithers or flies. A dozen of
his Runesons too have made their
mark, having garnered enough fame
in battle to qualify them to lead their
own lodge. Yet even amongst that
roll call of heroes one stands out:
Grimwrath Berzerker Braegrom,
Blessed of Grimnir. A terror of the
battlefield, Braegrom carves a path of
red ruin through anything he faces.

ON THE RISE

18

There are hundreds of different Fyreslayer lodges, and while none yet match Vostarg or Greyfyrd in size or
renown, there are a number that are gaining ground. Each lodge is greatly influenced by their home-realm, and is
identified by its own unique runes, traditions and distinctive colours.

HERMDAR

The Hermdar are descended from
the Grymdar, one of the first-forged
lodges, whose hold of Karadrum was
captured early in the Age of Chaos.
With their royal family slain, the
remnants elected the greatest Karl
amongst them as Runefather. Taking
the name Hermdar-Grimnir, he led
them in an oath to retake their lost
kingdom, slaying every one of the
skaven and Chaos enslavers that
had despoiled it. The Runefather
commanded the old hold to be

sealed with magma, and founded
the Hermdar lodge beneath the
mountain range known as the
Adamantine Chain. It was from the
fires at the heart of those peaks that
they unlocked the secret of blending
fyresteel so that it never lost the heat
of its first forging.

The Hermdar have become well
known in Aqshy. Oath-takers and
skull-breakers, the lodge played a
vital role in preserving the freedom
of the region’s peoples during the
Age of Chaos. They take what gold
they can, but are known to fight
tyranny even without pay.

LOFNIR

The Lofnir boast vaults filled with
Magmadroth eggs. They rear more
of the beasts than any other lodge,
and their bond with the creatures is
stronger. Perhaps this is because the
Lofnir venerate Vulcatrix alongside
Grimnir, seeing in the godbeast
the same fiery temperament as
that of the duardin battle-god.
The lodge is also famous for the
skill of their Zharrgrim priests,
who show a particular aptitude for
magmic summonations.

The Lofnir’s warriors are easily
identified by their soot-stained
hands and feet, markings that are
gradually made permanent over the
course of battles by ritual tattoos.
This distinctive appearance has its
roots in a rite of passage, as would-be
warriors must traverse a bridge of

red-hot fyresteel whilst carr ying a
Magmadroth egg. It is also said to
harken back to Grimnir’s fight with
Vulcatrix, during which – according
to the Battlesmiths – the god himself
started to burn from the intense
heat radiating the molten hide of the
Mother of Salamanders.

TANGRIM

The Tangrim settled
in the Realm of
Heavens after Sigmar
re-opened the Gates
of Azyr. Grim and
honourable, they often
ally with Stormcast
Eternals. The Tangrim
refuse to accept the coin
of any who follow the Dark
Gods, although whether this
is their own judgement or simply a wise consideration by
those who live in Sigmar’s domain is unknown.

ULRUNG

The Ulrung lodge of
Shyish mark their
beards, faces and fists
in the white ash of the
dead. Their forges have
gone cold but their fyrds
fight on. Whether they
can establish a new
magmahold or retake
their old one from the
undead spirits that seized
it remains to be seen, but their long sur vival in the
underworlds of Shyish has made them grim indeed.

BAELDRAG

Scions of the
Vostarg,
the
Baeldrag dwell in the
Wandering Mountains
of Ghyran, and are
sworn enemies of
the skaven. Even
without hope of
profit they have attacked
the ratmen, ever since
Runefather Grumgen-Grimnir’s
two eldest Runesons
were captured by the Grey Seer Kritket Doomeye and
stitched into the abomination known as Ummglug.

SIGYORN

The members of the
Sigyorn lodge bear
deep red tattoos with
symbols of warrior
kinship. They hail
from the Forge Cities
of Chamon. Protected by
lava-falls, this stronghold
has grown in size and attracts
business and trade from many of the Free Peoples that
live in the Realm of Metal. Those of Sigyorn have sold
their axes in service to the Kharadron Overlords on
many different occasions.

THUNGUR

The Thungur lodge rule
the glimmering
peaks of Lunarest
in Hysh. They
have fought
several wars with
the aelves of those
lands. Amongst their
strange customs are melting
ur-gold under giant lenses, and creating a golden powder
from their forges’ by-products. Warriors of this lodge
often glimmer with a dusting of this substance, and in
battle their Runesmiters can cause it to ignite.

GELVAGD

Another splinter of the
Vostarg lodge, these
Fyreslayers have settled in
Azyrheim, where they are
known as stone-hearted
mercenaries. The Gelvagd
have a forge-temple in the
Eternal City, and are known
for their vindictive streak. All
the lodge’s grudges are chiselled into metal, and when
they are settled they are cast into the forge and melted
to help form the molten moat that separates their lodge
from the rest of the populous city.

VOLTURUNG

Claiming direct descent
from the first-forged,
the Volturung of Aqshy
are famed for the skill
of their Runesmiters.
Using magmic powers,
they have carven the
entire volcanic slope of
their mountainous home
into an image of Grimnir.
They were the first lodge to ally with the Stormcast
Eternals, and since then they have fulfilled many oaths
fighting alongside Sigmar’s warriors.

CAENGAN

Long ago, the Caengan
lodge settled in the Realm
of Ulgu seeking hidden
ur-gold in the mists.
They learned many subtle
and clandestine ways from
their former clients, the
Shroudling Kings, but
following a disagreement
over lack of remuneration,
Caengan fyrds ransacked the
kingdom, taking not only their outstanding payment but
also a stern measure of retribution.

THE SOUL WARS COMETH

THE SOUL WARS COMETH

The Fyreslayers weathered the Age of Chaos, defending their magmaholds and expanding during an era of terror
and war. The Age of Sigmar began with promise, as the dominion of Chaos was lifted from many lands and
growing civilisations offered new opportunities to earn ur-gold, yet trouble was brewing in Shyish…

When Sigmar re-opened the Heavens
and unleashed his Stormcast
Eternals upon the Mortal Realms,
he began a new era. The battles
of the Realmgate Wars aided the
Fyreslayers. They relieved some of
the building pressure that the armies
of the Dark Gods were exerting, for
during the long Age of Chaos the
Fyreslayers had been the only force
of Order to stand firm against them.
Now, with new enemies to contend
with, many of the Chaos armies
were drawn off to fight elsewhere.
Sieges that had lasted decades were
abandoned or weakened, allowing
duardin counter-attacks to finally
drive them off.

This new epoch was filled with
battles, for many factions that had
long remained hidden emerged to
strike a blow against their Chaos
oppressors. The mercenary services
of the Fyreslayers were in great
demand, and no few lodges were
forced to expand their treasure
vaults. The coveted ur-gold was
not merely stockpiled, however,
as the constant wars allowed the
Fyreslayers to release its pent-up
power at rates never before seen. It
was a time of great prosperity.

As Sigmar’s alliance reclaimed
lands, cities and civilisations began
to be raised once more. Although
the Fyreslayers did not aid in any
building, they did help in their
own way,
for there were orruks to
scour, ogor tribes to hunt down, and
beastmen to beat back into the wilds.

Over time, several Fyreslayer lodges
established close ties with the new
cities of Order. It was not unusual
in larger settlements to see fyrds of
Fyreslayers marching in and out to
collect their fees. Some lodges – such
as Bulder and Hermdar – developed
closer ties, and the Tangrim lodge
even built a forge-temple within the
city of Azyrheim. Across the Mortal
Realms many Runesons struck out to
found new lodges, and some of these

grew rich hiring out their services to
the burgeoning cities. And then the
winds shifted, and a time of dread
omens and malign portents began.

a tidal wave of death magic that
raged unchecked across the realms.
Thus began the Soul Wars.

PORTENTS OF DOOM

Fell shadows lengthened across the
Mortal Realms, and dark omens
were everywhere for those that could
see them. For a long time this did
not include the Fyreslayers, who
went about their mercenary business
as usual, showing a combination
of duardin practicality and gruff
disdain for any form of soothsaying.
Yet soon, when the sun disappeared
for days on end during dark solstices,
even the surliest of Fyreslayers began
to feel the unnatural chill that was
creeping over every realm.

Gazing from hollow eye sockets,
Nagash, Supreme Lord of the
Undead and self-proclaimed ruler of
Shyish, could still see much. It was
Nagash’s unwavering belief that the
souls of all mortal creatures should
pass to him upon their death, for he
was the ruler of the underworlds. He
gazed upon the Mortal Realms and
saw many races that withheld his
due: the Sylvaneth sought to recycle
the souls of their fallen, while the
recently discovered Idoneth Deepkin
were actually stealing souls for their
own mysterious uses. Worst of all,
Sigmar, who still sought Nagash
as an ally in the great war against
Chaos, was plucking the brightest
souls of mankind to forge his
Stormcast Eternals.

Enraged, Nagash forswore all others,
denouncing even former allies as
thieves and betrayers, and therefore
enemies. Enacting a plan long in the
making, the god attempted to drown
all life in a flood of necromantic
magic. It was this dire event that
triggered the many omens of doom
that were witnessed across the
Mortal Realms. While the Great
Necromancer’s ultimate goal was
foiled, he did succeed in unleashing

THE NECROQUAKE

Nagash’s
ritual triggered a great
evil, a sorcerous blast known as the
Shyish necroquake, for its epicentre
was in the Realm of Death. Across
the realms the dead awoke, all lands
were faced with invasions by spectral
hosts – phantasmal horrors that
sought revenge against the living
– and fell magics flowed unbound
throughout the realms.

For the Fyreslayers the attacks were
a shock. Lodges from all the Mortal
Realms came under sudden and
intense assault. Magmaholds that
had held out against innumerable
foes during the Age of Chaos now
found their defences availed them
little against spirit-armies that could
materialise within their mountain
strongholds, bypassing hundreds
of feet of solid rock. Phantom
hosts simply floated over rivers of
magma that had once held back
Chaos hordes.

In Aqshy,
the Vardhraz lodge fell
in a single day to a surging undead
horde – there were no survivors.
The magmahold of Brynbak was
breached for the first time in its
long history. Its stout defenders
managed to stave off defeat and
destroy the invaders, though only
through emptying their treasure
vaults in order to craft enough runes
for their armies. The lodge’s Vulkite
Berzerkers were so overloaded with
ur-gold that those who survived
the hammering-in process became
unstoppable ki l ling machines,
cleaving great swathes through the
spectral hordes. Yet
it was a victory
at great cost, for many of the duardin
warriors that survived the battle
expired shortly after. Their hearts
had burst, for even robust Fyreslayer
frames are rarely able to withstand
so much divine power.

21

While magmaholds in all the realms
were assailed, the lodges of Shyish
bore the brunt of the necromantic
storm. Half a dozen holds were
wiped away by the Nighthaunt
spearheads, and an equal number
had their bloodlines severed. Some
suffered a slain Runefather, while
others lost their entire royal family.
The Bharnak lodge lost all members
of their ruling dynasty except for a
single Runeson, making the matter
of succession easy. Others were not
so fortunate. After their patriarch fell
beneath a surging tide of Chainrasps,
the last remaining Runeson of the
Durnhok lodge was so overcome
with grief he immediately vowed to
become a Doomseeker. Ever faithful,
the entire lodge took a similar oath
and became grimnyn, destined
also to wander the realms as slayers
without hearth or home.

EVIL TIDINGS

The waves of undead were not the
only effect of the necroquake. Just
as those who were slain continued
to fight, so too did many sorcerous
conjurations linger long after they
should have expired. Mages across

the realms found the potency
and longevity of their spells
greatly increased.

Buffeted by fell winds, many
magmaholds in Shyish witnessed
the eternal flame of their forge-
temple guttering like a candle in a
hurricane. Several – including those
of the Ulrung and Zhuffnok lodges –
were snuffed out altogether.

By the light of

the Zharrkhul,

I shall awaken from stone-sleep,

And once more see my ancestors,

And take my place amongst

them.

- Rites of

the Pyre

With nothing but cooling embers
where flames should be, the warriors
of the Zhuffnok lodge underwent
the ritual of grimnyn. Their death-
songs sung, they marked their
faces with white skull-masks and
marched out to find either hope or
a glorious ending. Although the
fires had gone out within their own
forges, those of the Ulrung lodge
did not give up hope, for the flames
in their fyresteel axes still burned

bright. With the runic protections
of their magmahold – the Ulfort –
lost, the lodge was forced to fight
their way out of their own halls to
escape the spectral hordes assailing
them. Cast out into the gloom of the
underworlds, the Ulrung began an
epic journey to escape Shyish.

There were more grim tidings. Since
its discovery by the Fyreslayers,
members of other races had failed to
recognise ur-gold for what it truly
was, save only the white-furred
sorcerers of the skaven. Yet now,
some of the undead forces were being
drawn to large ur-gold deposits and
attempting to plunder them. Where
the worst of the eldritch storm
thrown up by the necroquake struck,
the powerful Shyishan magic had
started to leech some of the ur-gold’s
power. It was as if Nagash himself
were stretching out his cold, bony
fingers to pluck at the Fyreslayers’
most coveted possession. The only
cure to stave off the slow siphoning
of Grimnir’s spirit was to ignite the
runes in the heat of battle. And there
was yet another ill omen: the Bad
Moon, casting its malevolent and
sickly light, was on the rise.

Ritual funeral pyres properly send the spark of a slain Fyreslayer’s being back to the resting nothingness known as the
stone-sleep, until the time when all duardin return to fight the last battle of the Doomgron.

LEGACY OF THE LODGES

LEGACY OF THE LODGES

Herein can be found the major deeds of the Fyreslayers following the loss of Grimnir, and through the ages of the
realms. Each lodge maintains their own oral histories as recalled by their Battlesmiths. The telling of these sagas
is an event in itself, a raucous celebration in the main hall with frequent toasts, stomping and cheering.

AGE OF MYTH

For most races this is a time of
legends, when the gods walk
amongst the realms and civilisations
are built up seemingly overnight.
For the Fyreslayers, however,
it is
a time of grief and introspection
as they come to terms with the
reality of losing their god. In many
of the growing empires, humans,
Sylvaneth, aelves and duardin
forge tight alliances, but not so the
Fyreslayers, for they shun contact
and only aid others – even their
former kin – in times of battle.

FIRST-FORGED

The followers of Grimnir form into
familial communities called lodges.
The earliest of these are known
as the first-forged, although some
lodges prefer the term Children of
Grimnir, and claim direct descent
from their god. There are dozens of
different lodges, with the largest and
most powerful being the Vostarg,
Drakendreng and Greygrend.

THE GLOWING KING

Rumenar-Grimnir,
the first
Runefather of the Drakendreng
lodge, drinks a caldera dr y of lava,
and in so doing discovers the perfect
site for a magmahold. Thus is the
Shimmerhold founded. For centuries
afterwards, Rumenar glows like a
raging volcano.

CURSED GENERATION

Through ill fortune, failed
bloodlines, civil strife or sheer
belligerence, the first generation
of lodges break apart. Of all the
Runesons that disperse, only one
ensures the name of his former
lodge, the Vostarg, wi l l
live on in
the next generation, although he
and his people leave their original
magmahold of Vosforge and settle
beneath Furios Peak.

AGE OF CHAOS

As attacks and invasions by minions
of the Dark Gods increase, so too

does corruption and infighting
across the civilisations of the Mortal
Realms. During the long centuries of
this age, the hot-blooded Fyreslayers
grow in number,
in riches, and
in truculence.

THE GATES ARE SHUT

As threats become more frequent,
the magmaholds shut their gates.
While this keeps the Fyreslayers
safe from invasion,
it also locks out
refugees from broken karaks.

FIRE-BLOODED BROTHERS

The Fyrdhand lodge is driven mad
with the first case of glimmerlust,
turning upon their Runemaster
and giving in completely to an
insatiable hunger for ur-gold. For
decades, the Fyrdhands raid other
lodges throughout Aqshy, prising
golden runes from the remains of
their brothers. They do not observe
the pyre-rites on either their own
dead or those of other Fyreslayers,
and even desecrate forge-temples
in their frenzied plundering. Only
an alliance of a dozen lodges led by
the Vostarg brings the Fyrdhands
to justice. The treacherous lodge’s
Runefather is buried alive in molten
slag as punishment for bringing
dishonour to Grimnir.

THE ETERNAL KEEP

The Grumnir lodge, scions of the
Harrworld, attack the Everliving
Keep – a fastness formed from the
roots of a Ghyran oak. However,
each time the Sylvaneth defenders
are cut down they swiftly grow back

again. Unwilling to break their
oath, the lodge refuse to back down
and choose to wage endless battle
rather than accept defeat. Eventually
the Runefather and his sons are
slain, and the lodge fractures.
The few survivors take vows to
become Doomseekers.

THE SHAME OF SHADESPIRE

In breach of their oath, the Vostarg
prove unable to prevent disaster
befalling the city of Shadespire.
Thus begins an odyssey to find the
Mirrored City, and end the curse
placed upon it by Nagash.

THE TIME OF FLAMES

Many generations after the death
of Grimnir, a time of cataclysmic
volcanic eruptions shakes the
Realm of Fire. A few magmaholds
are swallowed up by the tortured
and churning lands. However,
the
upheavals are also seen as a sign that
Grimnir’s spirit is fighting to be free.
In the disaster’s wake, tons of ur-gold
are brought to the surface, and many
new lodges are born during the gold-
harvest that follows.

THE MAGMAHOLD WARS

The armies of Chaos seek to destroy
the Fyreslayers. All the major
magmaholds and many smaller
ones are held in a constant state
of siege. Daemonic engines and
ratmen sappers batter and claw their
way into some holds, committing
countless atrocities. Yet after more
than a century of war, the Fyreslayers
remain, having weathered all the
Dark Gods could throw at them.

THE PYRE WAR

The skaven prove most adept at
penetrating magmaholds. Most
invasions are halted, but several
lesser lodges are destroyed in
the fighting. During these fierce
campaigns the ratmen discover
something of the power of ur-gold.
Although not as precious to them
as warpstone, the skaven begin to
consume the duardin dead, ur-gold


PAGEBREAK
23

runes and all, in the hope of imbuing
themselves with empowering
energies. The Fyreslayers ensure
that funeral pyres are constructed
as soon as possible in the wake
of any conflict, to prevent this
heinous desecration.

THE CALL OF UR-GOLD

Rich new veins of ur-gold are
discovered in the Realms of Ghyran,
Ghur and Shyish. Heeding the siren
call, hundreds of Runesons set off
with their Runefathers’ blessings
to found new lodges, sparking the
largest Fyreslayer migration since
the Time of Flames. Across the
realms, armies swell with duardin
mercenaries as new lodges make
their presence known.

AGE OF SIGMAR

Sigmar’s Tempest
is felt in even
the deepest magmaholds. Drawn
by battle and the prospect of fresh
mercenary contracts, the Fyreslayers
join conflicts without number.

A LIGHTNING OATH

Fyreslayers of the Tangrim lodge
stand beside the Hammers of Sigmar
defending a hidden Realmgate from
rampaging Bloodbound. They are
paid in coin from Azyr that contains
traces of ur-gold, news that quickly
makes it way to all lodges.

SETTLING IN AZYRHEIM

For the first time,
lodges migrate to
Azyr seeking ur-gold. Some of them
whisper that Grimnir’s return is
close at hand.

TO DEFEAT THE IRONHOLDS

Runefather Hursgar-Grimnir takes
a gold-oath to aid the Stormcast
Eternals in taking the Ironholds
and seizing the Mercurial Gate, the
Chamonic link to the Allpoints.
Forming a coalition with a half-
dozen related lodges, the patriarch
of the Greyfyrd tasks a gathering of
Runesmiters with opening a tunnel
beneath the shifting iron bastions
to get close to the main gates. The
plan nearly works, until the arrival
of the godbeast Argentine, the
Silver Wyrm, and finally Archaon
the Everchosen himself. When
Dracothion arrives and destroys the
last bridge, Hursgar is left unable to

complete the task, and has no choice
but to lead his fyrds in fighting their
way back out,
leaving the Stormcast
Eternals to die alone. One day he
hopes to return and fulfil the oath.

MALIGN PORTENTS

Nightmares and visions of ruin beset
the realms as a dark solstice occurs.
The dead rise in unprecedented
numbers to attack the living.

SLAYERS OF TYRANTS

There is rough agreement amongst
most lodges of the value of any
given type of mercenary venture,
but some Fyreslayers grumble that
the Hermdar are undercutters. The
Hermdar’s reputation is cemented
when it becomes widely known
among the Zharrgrim that they
accepted shockingly low payment
to destroy the prison-fortress of
Blackiron while also embarking
upon the gruelling Cracked Plain
campaign to end the gut-tyranny
of Thogbrute, and without even
demanding gold up front. The
Hermdar do not mind that the
human tribes who dwell near the
Adamantine Chain have begun to
call them the Slayers of Tyrants,
for
the duardin deem it to be a moniker
that is good for business.

SOUL WARS

The Shyish necroquake sends waves
of death magic crashing across the
realms. All Fyreslayer cities are
soon assailed as the dead wake and
phantasmal hosts stalk the lands.
Magmaholds fall at a rate unheard of
in the long history of the Fyreslayers.
All of the lodges in Shyish suffer
losses, with several destroyed and
others forced to vacate as their
strongholds are breached. Several
lodges take the vow of grimnyn.

In addition to the assaults upon
their magmaholds, many Fyreslayer
fyrds are engaged as mercenaries
across the Mortal Realms. With
the increase in magical energies,
Zharrgrim priests find their magmic
powers enhanced as well.

BAD MOON RISING

A further baleful omen fill the skies
as the leering celestial body known
as the Bad Moon rises more often.
Dozens of magmaholds are assailed
by hordes of grots. Some invasions,
such as the feeble attack upon Furios
Peak, are beaten back with ease.
Other holds do not fare so well, as
several smaller lodges are overrun.
These are grim signs, as the sickly
moon has only begun to wax large.

THE DUARDRAZHAL

During the Battle of Blackstorm
on the boundaries of Hammerhal
Aqsha, the heroics of the Vostarg
lodge ensure not only victory but
also doubled pay from that city.
During the week-long Ghuzfest
that follows, the Fyreslayers invite
their duardin cousins from the
city to join in the festivities, and
even extend the offer to an allied
Kharadron Overlords skyfleet. So
much magmalt ale flows that many
songs are sung in the old language,
but young Runeson Rolth lets the
cups get the better of him, divulging
the truth of ur-gold and Grimnir.
To the Fyreslayers’ surprise,
such knowledge only gains them
support and eventually leads to the
duardrazhal , the unification ta lks
which ripple through the duardin
populations of Azyrheim to the sky-
ports of Chamon.

THE MASTER MAKER

Rumours of Grungni’s
return spread
throughout the duardin factions,
from Fyreslayer lodges to the
Kharadron's aerial domains, as well
as the Dispossessed and Ironweld
Arsenal garrisons in the free cities of
the Mortal Realms. It is said that the
patriarch of the duardin pantheon
has returned from his self-imposed
exile and founded a new stronghold
hidden beneath the mountains
of Chamon. There are those who
whisper that, in solitude, the Forge
God is crafting something wondrous
that wi l l reunify his scattered
children. Reports differ on what
this could be, from a new duardin
bloodline to a great machine, or
even a way to bring back the missing
goddess of the hearth. Whether
such claims are true or merely the
result of too much strong liquor and
hidden hopes remains unknown.

FYRESLAYERS AT WAR

24

FYRESLAYERS AT WAR

The entirety of Fyreslayer society is built to support their fyrds, the armies that march out of the magmaholds. It
is through their warriors’ efforts that ur-gold is seized from foes, or earned as payment for mercenary ser vices.
Already linked by familial bonds, the fyrds grow tighter still as they fight and endure campaigns together.

It began with Grimnir. Hot-
tempered and impulsive, the
warrior-god was as loyal as he was
combative. Dauntless to the point
of recklessness, Grimnir feared no
foe. He took pride in his skill at arms
and his oaths were unbreakable. That
same bloodline and those same fiery
traits flow through the Fyreslayers.
This divine wellspring is passed from
father to son, and from this spirit
of fur y are born the lodges and the
fyrds within them.

Fyreslayer lodges are the family
groups of a warrior culture. Their
main purpose is to provide for the
fyrds, the armies that march out of
the magmahold in search of gold. To
a Fyreslayer,
the quest to find ur-gold
and unlock its hidden powers in
battle is ever ything. They are single-
minded and driven, exhibiting great
zeal in the pursuit of these matters.
Fyreslayers are equally fierce about
the protection of their lodge, for
such is the society that enables the
fyrds to pursue their holy quest: the
collection of the shattered remnants
of Grimnir and the release of their
energy in the crucible of war.

Some lodges contain just one fyrd,
perhaps comprising the Runefather
and a handful of loyal duardin, while
there are those magmaholds, vast
by comparison, that can field many
scores of different fyrds, each one
numbering in the thousands and led
to battle by the Runefather or one of
his plentiful Runesons.

FYRD ORGANISATION

A lodge, including its fyrds, is
ruled by a single patriarch, the
Auric Runefather.
It is by his wi l l
that fyrds are mustered, and it is
his responsibility to equip, train
and house them. Adding the title
of ‘Grimnir’ to his name to honour
his god, this great Fyreslayer is
the descendant of a bloodline that
stretches back to the Age of Myth.
As a leader in a warrior-cult, the

Runefather constantly seeks combat
himself. In accordance with his
status, he wi l l always head a fyrd
when the battle is vital to the
lodge’s existence, when the action
commands the highest mercenary
price, or when he feels it has been too
long since his axe has tasted combat.
For battles of lesser stature, the
Runefather wi l l send one of his sons
to command in his stead.

At the Runefather’s
side stand his
Runesons, who are skilled fighters
and bold leaders in their own right.
It is the hope of all Runesons that,
in time, they might inherit rule of
the lodge. Each eternally strives to
stand above his brothers, for they are
judged by their martial prowess and
ability to command. It is a system
that has endured for countless
generations, and has seen the
Fyreslayers grow strong in Grimnir’s
service, in spite of the brutality of the
Age of Chaos.

Alongside the Runefather and his
sons are the Zharrgrim priests, of
which there are two types vital to
the fyrds. It is the Runemasters who
rule the entire Zharrgrim order,
and each holds authority over his
lodge’s
forge-temple. It is his duty to
safeguard his people’s ur-gold, and
he who shapes it at the forge, casting
it into runes. The Runemaster
either pounds the runes into the
flesh of the warriors himself, or
directs his undersmiters to do so.
Each lodge has but one who holds
the rank of Runemaster, and the

secret knowledge that accompanies
this station. Although much of a
Runemaster’s
time is spent in the
forge-temple, he wi l l join a fyrd at
need, unleashing his magmic powers
to devastating effect upon the foe.

Runesmiters are the most common
of the Zharrgrim priests, and an
essential part of a fyrd. It is their role
to unlock the energy of the ur-gold
runes, a feat that can only be done
in combat. Thus, Runesmiters can
always be found in the midst of
any fighting. A lodge can have any
number of Runesmiters, and they
are known to attach themselves to
specific Berzerker formations or
even to lead them on the field of
battle. Channelling the molten rock
beneath their feet, Runesmiters can
bore tunnels underground, a tactic
they often use to strike the enemy
from an unexpected quarter.

In addition to ensuring the war
spirit of Grimnir flows strong within
each member of a fyrd, it is the task
of the Zharrgrim priests to advise
the Runefather and his sons. It is
rare for a Fyreslayer to be able to
fully control their temper, but the
Zharrgrim train to do so, and have
mastered the ability to alloy their
aggression with wisdom. Typically
they offer the fyrd’s commander
counsel on matters related to ur-
gold, oath-making and rites of battle.

Vulkite Berzerkers form the bulk of
most fyrds. They are professional
warriors utterly dedicated to
battle, earning gold and fu lfi l ling
the lodge’s oaths. The strongest
and most able of their number are
given the title Karl, and they serve
as champions within the different
Berzerker units. The size and
strength of the Vulkite formations
var y from lodge to lodge. Some,
like the most ancient and powerful
magmaholds of Aqshy, boast tens
of thousands of Vulkite Berzerkers.
Others, such as lodges in remote
lands or those newly formed

by former Runesons, are but a
handful of brave warriors led by a
single Runefather.

Most fyrds are accompanied by a
Battlesmith, a fearsome warrior that
carries an icon of Grimnir. He is a
chronicler of events, for he witnesses
the deeds of the fyrds and recites
them in the magmahold’s Hall of
Fyre. Thus are the epic tales of the
past preserved in living memory, for
each Battlesmith must learn all the
tales that have come before.

The elite of the Fyreslayer troops
are the Hearthguard. These are
chosen from the Vulkites’
ranks.
The strongest and most formidable
in combat are taken into the
Hearthguard Berzerkers, who are
typically charged with protecting
the fyrd’s leader, be it Runefather or
Runeson. The Auric Hearthguard
serve as the guard of the Zharrgrim
priests. In the magmahold it is their
duty to defend the forge-temple,

although units not assigned to this
task often accompany fyrds to battle.

Finally there are the individuals
that stand outside the conventional
structure of the fyrds: the
Grimwrath Berzerkers and
Doomseekers. A Grimwrath
Berzerker is the lodge’s best and
most driven warrior. Truly blessed
by Grimnir,
they are akin to avatars
of destruction, through which the
ancient might of the battle-god lives
on. They excel at the expenditure
of ur-gold runes, burning them up
in such violent displays of martial
prowess that their skin smokes, and
sparks fly from their sizzling beards.

Doomseekers are lone wanderers
who are on a quest to end their life
in some heroic fashion. To recharge
themselves with runic might, these
fated individuals wi l l temporarily
join a fyrd in action, trading their
formidable combat skills for a fresh
supply of ur-gold runes.

T o reach Aric-Grimnir,
the warriors had to
pass mounded dead.
By all r ights, the Runefather
should have died several
times over. He bled from a
score of wounds, but w ith his
remaining arm he still held the
enormous latchkey grandaxe.
Waving off any offers of help,
Aric growled.
‘Who felled the gargant? ’
‘It was your son Arnolf,’
replied the Karl.
‘He bowled
over his brothers as he raced to
reach the creature first.’
The smile that creased the
Runefather’s broken face was
not at all pleasant.
‘It is good.
Then it is to Arnolf that I
bequeath my axe. I go now, to
wait for Grimnir.’
High was stacked that battle’s
v ictory pyre, and all flagons
were lifted to Aric’s honour at
the ensuing Ghuzfest.

Heirs of Grimnir

26

HEIRS OF GRIMNIR

There are no figures more important to the Fyreslayers than the warrior-leaders of a lodge, the Auric Runefather
and his Runesons. Down the generations are the gifts of Grimnir passed, and it is their duty to lead the fyrds to
victory, to honour all oaths and to bring in as much ur-gold as possible.

AURIC RUNEFATHERS

Warrior king. Lodge leader. Oath
keeper. Master of the magmahold.
An Auric Runefather is all these
things and more. The blood of
Grimnir flows like a molten river
through the veins of the Auric
Runefathers. This touch of divinity
accounts for not only their
might in battle, but also their
fearsome aura. Weak-willed
opponents have been known
to flee rather than face a
Runefather’s wrath, for
the duardin’s fiery
glower bores into
their foes, causing
even the bravest of
enemies to quail.

Inheriting the title of Runefather
has a way of turning even the most
reckless of Runesons into something
more grim and stoic. For a lodge to
prosper,
two things are required:
an inflow of ur-gold and battles
through which to release its godly
energy. It is a constant demand. The
Battlesmiths keep a detailed history
of each Runefather’s deeds, including
how many foes were defeated during
their reign and whether there are
any unsettled grudges from that
time. The Zharrgrim priests tally
how much ur-gold is acquired under
a Runefather’s
rule. Great pressures
wear on a Runefather,
for not only
are they measured against the
glorious deeds of their forebears,
but their broad shoulders must also
bear the responsibility
of finding and
freeing the
essence of their
shattered god.

As befits those who claim distant
kinship with Grimnir, Runefathers
are powerful warriors, able to stand
toe to toe with hulking monsters
or the mightiest of foes. As lodge
leader, a Runefather’s
rage must
be tempered with wisdom. He has
learnt when to charge to the fore and
when to hold back, marshalling not
only his own impetuous nature but
that of his people. Only the bellowed
command of a Runefather can halt
Berzerkers from heedlessly throwing
themselves at a foe. The presence of
a Runefather within the Fyreslayer
battleline bolsters the warriors’
already considerable will, ensuring
that the doughty duardin wi l l never
flee a fight but wi l l hold their ground
and slog it out with any enemy.

‘Hear me, my scions, and I will

tell

ye the same as I heard from my own

forebear. Only one can bear the lodge’s

grandaxe.

I shall name as heir he

whose deeds prove best – he who fells

the mightiest

foes and brings before

the proud name of Vostarg the greatest

tribute to Grimnir. May the blaze of

battle burn bright within you all.’

- Bael-Grimnir,

Runefather of

the Vostarg

The Runefathers possess
the greatest heirlooms
of their lodge. The most
ancient of these date
back to the first-forged,
and include many objects
of awesome power, yet
none are more sacred than
the long-hafted latchkey
grandaxe. Handed down
from father to son, these
blazing weapons not only
strike with enough force to
cleave an orruk in twain, but
with their notched design they
can trap and sunder enemy blades.
Furthermore, each of these axes is
the master key to the lodge’s great
forge-temple vault and its stores of
precious ur-gold.

AURIC RUNESONS

Filled with reckless enthusiasm and
a burning desire to prove themselves,
Auric Runesons are each potential
heirs to the throne of their lodge.
While many other races grant the
mantle of command to their leader’s
first-born, such is not the way of the
Fyreslayers. The Runeson that wi l l
become Runefather must establish
himself as the most worthy.

As a follower of Grimnir,
the best
way for a Runeson to distinguish
himself is with feats of arms. Thus
do the brothers compete with one
another, vying to lug the greatest
trophies back to the lodge, or to be
first to charge the enemy’s lines,
often singling out the largest or most
imposing foes as their quarry. The
fighting prowess of each Runeson is
carefully displayed within his lodge,
where gargant skulls are stacked
and the captured banners of enemy
armies hang for all to see.

Because of the dangerous nature
of Runeson competition, along
with their reckless bravery and
inherent disregard for death, it is a

wise Runefather that sires as many
progeny as he can over his long life.
Many of the most successful
lodges
have a dozen or more Runesons
striving at the same time for the
right to one day rule.

MAGMADROTHS

As the Fyreslayers’ ruling dynasties
are the children of Grimnir, so
too are the Magmadroths the
offspring of Vulcatrix. Ever since
the epic battle between duardin
god and godbeast, a bond has
existed between the descendants
of these mythic combatants. Most
often the feud is continued, for
both seek the smouldering caverns
and tunnels beneath the volcanic
mountain ranges of the realms as
their dwelling places. It was the
Zharrgrim priests who learned the
secrets of hatching Magmadroth
eggs and hand-raising the volatile
beasts, though only the most noble-
blooded of the Fyreslayers have
shown the prowess and willpower
required to persuade a fully-grown
Magmadroth to serve them as a
battle mount.

Born of flame and fury, the heat
of a Magmadroth causes the air
around them to ripple. In battle, the
reptilian creatures rake prey with
their enormous claws, gouge them
with their razor-sharp horns, crush
them in their powerful jaws and
bring their tails lashing down with
the impact of a falling ironoak.

With a bellowing roar, a
Magmadroth can spew flaming bile
that ignites all it touches, burning
through flesh and armour alike.
They are protected by thick scales,
so that only the stoutest of blows
can penetrate their hides. Even
a telling strike can have deadly
consequences for an attacker,
for jets
of flaming-hot blood spurt from a
Magmadroth’s wounds.

When riding to war atop a
Magmadroth, an Auric Runefather,
Runeson, or Runesmiter becomes a
threat that commands the attention
of even the most powerful foes. The
Magmadroth and its Fyreslayer
rider are capable of single-handedly
staving in an enemy centre or
breaking apart an entire flank.

THE CHOSEN AXES

The Chosen Axes are a hand-picked warband of elite
Fyreslayers that accompany the legendary Runefather
Fjul-Grimnir. Endless battles have honed the warriors’
fighting skills, and their skin has been hardened with
not just ur-gold runes but so many scars that only the
best-aimed strikes can now wound them. They care
little for defence, however,
for like Grimnir himself,
they are the epitome of aggression. In combat the
warband attacks like a storm of axe-blades, with Fjul-
Grimnir at the centre of the maelstrom.

Fjul-Grimnir, great grandfather to the current Vostarg
ruler Bael-Grimnir, could not bear sending others in
his place to atone for the mistakes of his ancestors. In
a fit of pique, Fjul had a new latchkey grandaxe forged
and chose one hundred of his finest warriors. Before
trekking off to the forbidden city, Fjul named one of
his sons as his successor. Long years have passed, and
those of Vostarg have never heard back from their lost
leader. Since that time, more fyrds have been sent,
yet no news of them or their former Runefather ever
reaches Furios Peak.

Honour and fu lfi l ling oaths are paramount to all
Fyreslayers, but to no lodge more so than the Vostarg.
One blemish alone rank les that noble line: the failure
to protect the city of Shadespire from the threat of
Nagash. It is a stain upon a proud history. Every
hundred years since that time, a new force is sent
into the twilight realm of the Mirrored City in an
attempt to remove the curse that haunts it. Thousands
of Fyreslayers have been lost in the endeavour, and
none have ever returned to tell their tales. However,
Fyreslayers are stubborn, and those of Vostarg
especially so. No matter the losses, no one would
ever suggest that the quest be abandoned. In the long
history of their attempts,
there has been only one foray
led by an Auric Runefather.

In Shadespire, armies and heroes alike die, but that
has not been the fate of Fjul-Grimnir – at least not
yet. There, amongst the ruins, Fjul fights on still.
In grinding years that seem to repeat and stretch
themselves well past sanity,
the formidable Runefather
has fought non-stop battles against foes beyond count.
Of his warband, only three remain – the mightiest
of the lot. Alongside Fjul, Tefk Flamebearer, Mad
Maegrim and Vol Orrukbane fight as one, their axes
blazing a flaming pattern of death. They have battled
together so long that they anticipate each other’s
movements, parr ying for one another or ducking their
comrades’ hurled axes as if it were second nature. Each
still hopes to end Shadespire’s
curse, complete their
ancient oath and restore their lodge’s honour.

Masters of the Forge

MASTERS OF THE FORGE

28

Since the Age of Myth, the Zharrgrim priests have led the search for Grimnir’s remains. It is they who discovered
ur-gold and mastered the secrets of forging it into runes, of hammering it into sturdy duardin warriors and
coaxing forth its great power. They seek to release that same divine energy in the heat of battle.

To join the Zharrgrim, a duardin
must show a strong affinity with
ur-gold and its wondrous properties.
There are various types of priest
within the order, each with their
own titles and responsibilities, but
the two most vital in warfare are the
Runemasters and the Runesmiters.

AURIC RUNEMASTERS

The high priest of a lodge’s
Zharrgrim order is a revered figure
known as an Auric Runemaster.
It
is they who craft the ur-gold runes
that are hammered into the flesh of
the Fyreslayers, granting the bearer
a sliver of the raw power of Grimnir.
Auric Runemasters are attuned to
their deity like no other, and can
sense deposits of ur-gold with an
unmatched keenness. Many legends
tell of Runemasters who could
sense ur-gold buried deep beneath
mountains, swallowed in the bellies
of enormous godbeasts, or even
hidden in other realms.

Unlike a Runesmiter, a Runemaster
has tempered his fiery nature,
drawing upon his great wisdom,
knowledge and connection with
Grimnir’s divine power to offer
invaluable counsel to his lodge's
Runefather. Not even the most
rash of lodge leaders would make
decisions on matters of ur-
gold, oaths of war or mercenary
contracts without first consulting
with the Runemaster. The role of
spiritual advisor, however, does not
necessarily mean that a Runemaster
is a peaceful and introspective
individual; they are Fyreslayers after
all. Rather, Runemasters are able to
think with a cool and rational head
while channelling their rampant
emotions into magmic energy.

As a weapon and symbol of office,
the high priest carries a brazier-staff
lit by the flames of his magmahold’s
great forge and imbued with a
portion of its immense power. It is
in times of war that a Runemaster

unleashes the fu l l force of his rage.
By focusing his fur y and slamming
the base of his staff upon the ground,
the very battlefield cracks asunder,
bathing the foe in magma that surges
up from below. The Runemaster can
also reach into the deep places of the
realm through a practice known
as magmic invocation. His
words can inflame the fiery
nature of his kin, making
their blood boil and
stoking their battle-
fur y to staggering
levels. He can raise
Runic Fyrewalls –
summoning them
up from the molten
depths – to block
the advance of
invaders, or he can
call upon the realm
itself to spit gobbets
of lava at the
enemy. Searing heat
rises at his word,
and he can surround
himself with a swirling
cloud of embers that
whip around him like a
swarm of angr y fireflies.
It is also within his power
to summon destructive
Aqshian elementals from
the fiery pits below, and
Magmic Battleforges
that set his comrades’
battle-spirits aflame.

Should a Runemaster sense
foes carr ying even the
smallest trace of ur-gold,

he wi l l call galthar-baraz ,

effectively declaring holy war
upon them. Upon hearing a
Runemaster’s proclamation,
the eyes of Fyreslayers
blaze with righteous
fur y and they redouble
their efforts to hack
down any foe that
would dare to
seize and hold
a portion of
their god.

AURIC RUNESMITERS

Runesmiters are the war-priests
of their lodge. It is in the thick of
combat where they do their work,
for their patron is a god of battle, not
a benign, contemplative deity. Only
amidst the clash of arms, the screams
of the dying and the coppery stench
of blood are Runesmiters truly in
their element. Chanting invocations
and brandishing their weapons of
office, they call forth the power of
Grimnir. As their war-song builds
to a booming crescendo, it brings to
life the energies of their fallen god.
Nearby ur-gold runes blaze brightly,
imbuing those who bear them with
fell-handed power.

Whether on foot or riding a ferocious
Magmadroth, Runesmiters prefer to
charge into the maelstrom of close
combat, where their skills are most
needed. For them, the heat of battle
is a literal thing, for their chanting
causes the Runesmiters themselves
to radiate waves of searing energy.
Such is the intensity of these warrior-
priests that their own vehemence
– a kind of battle-joy – exudes
outwards, setting off ur-gold runes

to a sparking, pulsing glow that
fills nearby Fyreslayers with vigour
and fury.

‘By the fires of creation I ignite thee,

By the blaze of destruction I invoke thee,

In the heat of battle,

Even metal

shall burn.

By the power of

the god-pyre,

Let flame beget flame.’

- War-chant of Holy Ignition

The release of Grimnir’s energies can
only happen in the blaze of battle. It
is this act that the Fyreslayers have
dedicated their very lives to, for this
is the height of their religion – a
pinnacle of fierce joy at the final
release of their god’s entrapped spirit.
It is not enough to merely free the
energies of the ur-gold, but to use
that force in combat – this act alone
is tribute worthy of Grimnir. Various
lodges react to such divine agitations
in different manners. The warriors
of the Vostarg lodge lift their voices
to join those of their Runesmiters,
while the Greyfyrd are inspired to

bellow their own war-oaths and hurl
curses at their foes in their harsh
and unforgiving tongue. Others,
like those from the Lofnir lodge, are
overcome with a mania, gnashing
their teeth and making savage
noises underscored by the hissing
of the rising flames that burn with
heightened intensity in the shafts of
their fyresteel axes.

Beyond the ability to ignite the
latent energies within ur-gold runes,
Runesmiters have developed other,
more elemental powers. From their
understanding of metal and rock
they are able to control magmic
forces, summoning cinderstorms or
wreathing their Magmadroth’s
claws
in flame. With their feet in contact
with the ground, they can enter a
trance-like state, using their minds to
shift molten rock and bore temporary
tunnels through the earth. Using
this ability, Runesmiters often lead
a formation of Fyreslayers to strike
enemy armies from an unexpected
quarter, as the duardin suddenly
charge forth from a glowing
underground tunnel that opens up
right before the foes’ eyes.

THE ZHARRGRIM PRIESTHOOD

Fire and warfare, rage and rune-casting, ur-gold and
forges: these are the concerns of the Zharrgrim, the
battle-priests of Grimnir. Beneath the Runemaster of a
large forge-temple are twelve different ranks, ranging
from the war-centric Runesmiters to the K linkin, who
stoke the blast furnaces and mind the eternal flame.

The Zharrgrim have evolved greatly since their
beginnings. In the time of Grimnir,
those who would
become priests began as makers, smiths who forged
the weapons of war. It was their task to bind the fur y
of fire and raging battle-spirit into the blade of an
axe. With their knowledge of forging and metals, it
was these individuals who first recognised ur-gold
and knew it for what it was. Since those days, the
Zharrgrim have further merged their skills in forging
and battle with the fires of their homeland, Aqshy, and
something even more elemental: the scorching flame
of Vulcatrix. It was not just the spirit of Grimnir that
the priests unlocked from ur-gold. In their mutual
destruction, the godbeast’s essence had alloyed itself
to that of the duardin battle-god, and one could not be
set free without loosing the other. Over long exposure
to the residual energies of Vulcatrix,
the Zharrgrim
have gained further mastery over flames and magma.
A Runesmiter pulls upon these forces to burn tunnels

underground with liquid rock, doing so by merging
the aggression of his own raging spirit with a pure
elemental power, the molten pulse of Aqshy itself.

Without
this connection to Vulcatrix,
it is doubtful
that the duardin would have instinctively known
how to hatch Magmadroth eggs and raise the volatile
spawnlings to adulthood. Without
the emerging
fire-skills of the Zharrgrim priests, they would not
have developed such a close bond with the creatures,
one that is closer to true friendship than the link
between beast and master. The unique abilities of the
Zharrgrim have been further bolstered by the surging
magics unleashed by the Shyish necroquake. Since that
time, Runemasters and Runesmiters have been able
to summon a host of elemental manifestations,
from
fiery beasts to a blazing war-forge that burns brightly
with the Zharrkhul, the Master Flame of Grimnir.
Such fires burn with the same intensity that the priests
alight within the runes of Grimnir. As impulsive as the
rest of their kin, the Zharrgrim priests do not dwell
for long upon the exact reasons why they are attuned
to magmic energies. Instead, they search for more ur-
gold and strive to release its energies in battle, for only
then can they free not only Grimnir, but Vulcatrix
also. It is their hope that both can be resurrected for
the final battle of Doomgron.

Champions of the Fyreslayers

30

CHAMPIONS OF THE FYRESLAYERS

There are some individuals that stand out amongst the Fyreslayers’ ranks who are not of their lodge’s royal line or
members of the Zharrgrim priesthood. Instead, these champions rise above their kin due to their skills and feats
of arms. When the fyrds march to battle, these fiercest of warriors are usually found at the fore of the fighting.

GRIMWRATH
BERZERKERS

A Grimwrath Berzerker is more than
just a lodge’s greatest warrior ; he is
considered to be the battle fur y of
Grimnir made manifest. Carving
trails of destruction through the
enemy ranks like the fire wyrms
of old, these grizzled duardin
wreak absolute ruin with their
fyrestorm greataxes.

Grimwrath Berzerkers are solitary
figures. They are considered gruff and
aggressive even by the standards of
the Fyreslayers. Indeed, Grimwrath
Berzerkers take belligerence to a new
level. Although it is this fur y that
makes them legendary fighters, it
also makes them ill-suited to lead.
Impulsive and prone to solving even
the mildest of disputes with bone-
breaking violence, they are rogues
not only in the eyes of outsiders, but
to those within their own lodge.

By ancient tradition, Grimwrath
Berzerkers stand apart from both
Runefather and Runemaster, neither
heirs to lodge rule nor answering to
the Zharrgrim priesthood. Unlike
the Doomseekers, however, they
remain loyal to one lodge, and do
not wander alone or seek their own
demise. During periods of extreme
rage, Grimwrath Berzerkers might
leave the magmahold in pursuit
of targets worthy of their martial
expertise, but such forays rarely
stray far from a lodge’s territory or
campaigning army.

It is an indomitable will and great
quantities of ur-gold that imbue
Grimwrath Berzerkers with their
unusual combat prowess. Even a
single ur-gold rune grants great
preternatural strength, and so
powerful are the fragments of
Grimnir that only the mightiest
warriors can bear more than a few.
The Grimwrath Berzerkers have
proven able to harness dozens. Even
the Runemasters do not know for
sure why this is, and the only way

to determine if a Fyreslayer has the
soul of a Grimwrath is for him to
take the Test of Wrath. It is a grim
process that only the most combative
of Berzerkers feels compelled to
undergo. Appeals to take this
dangerous trial are almost always
denied by the Zharrgrim priests, but
with each refusal, those who feel its
siren lure grow increasingly difficult
to control. Their bodies begin to
smoulder, glowing like embers in the
dark until, at last, a Runemaster gives
his begrudging blessing.

‘One is for glory,

Two is for gold,

Three is for furore,

A terror

to behold.’

- Runesmiter’s hammerchant

After a series of rituals, the final
part of the Test of Wrath is the
hammering of rune after rune into
the aspirant’s body until his flesh
rejects their molten touch, the spirit
of Grimnir awakens within him, or
he is burnt to cinders in a roaring
pillar of fire. Many do not survive,
and some that do emerge either
quite mad or wholly consumed
by gold-rage.

At best antisocial and at worst insane,
Grimwrath Berzerkers find their
purpose in the heart of battle. Only
in the maelstrom of combat do they
find some measure of contentment,
for they enter a single-minded state
of ferocity. Suffused with the spirit
of their god, they snarl eye-watering
insults while hewing gore-strewn
swathes through the enemy army.
Perversely,
the more foes that
surround a Grimwrath Berzerker, the
greater he glowers with the energies
of Grimnir. He becomes so enraged
that his fyrestorm great axe becomes
a blur of constant motion, and he
ignores wounds that would fell a
Rockgut Troggoth.

BATTLESMITHS

Duardin venerate the past, and the
Fyreslayers are no exception to this
rule. Each lodge is known by its
deeds, including the battles it has
won, the ur-gold it has accumulated,
and the oaths its members have
honoured. These events are neither
written in tomes nor are they
chiselled in stone, but rather they
are committed to memory by those
known as Battlesmiths.

When the fyrds march to war,
Battlesmiths stand at the fore of the
Fyreslayers’ ranks so that they can
witness the most heroic moments
for recitation. They are the living
memory of their lodge, and they
chant their sagas in the magmahold’s
great hall of fyre, around fire-pits
while on campaign, and even amidst
the clash of arms while fighting
alongside their brethren.

Battlesmiths are not merely
chroniclers, but like all Fyreslayers
are fierce warriors. They carr y more
than an axe into battle, however,
for it is also a Battlesmith’s honour
to hoist aloft the icon of Grimnir.
Fyreslayers rally to this image,
emboldened by the intoned glories of
their lodge’s
storied past. All within
earshot fight with renewed vigour
as their ur-gold runes blaze with
rekindled energies.

Each lodge has its own festivals,
usually epic drinking bouts during
which the Battlesmiths recite the
history of the lodge from the days of
its founding. Every generation and
their deeds are recounted, which for
the older lodges, such as Greyfyrd
and Vostarg, can take weeks on end.

Battlesmiths are chosen by the
Runefather, who selects them from
the greatest of the lodge’s
forge
workers. It falls upon them to make
their own icons of Grimnir, and
only the most gifted of metalsmiths
have the skill to craft such a revered
symbol to the required standards.

DOOMSEEKERS

Many are the fates that can cause a
Fyreslayer to take the barazakdum ,
the doom-oath. This could be
a grave failure, a broken vow,
unrequited love, the fracturing of
a lodge, or any number of other
equally tragic occurrences. Some
of these transgressions or quirks of
fate might seem trivial to a human
observer, but not so to a duardin.

Those who speak the fatalistic oath
must leave their lodge. Their last act
is to craft their own weapons, using
the eternal blaze of their people’s
master forge to light the brazier of
their doomseeker axe before turning
their back on hearth and home. It is
their destiny to wander the Mortal
Realms in search of not redemption
– for there can be none – but a doom
worthy of an epic saga.

In truth, most who take the doom-
oath die quickly,
for the realms
are dangerous for lone travellers,
and even more so for those actively
seeking out monsters or mighty
champions to challenge. Marching

off into the wilds is typically fatal,
and many a Doomseeker finds a
fast and ignominious death. Some
starve, while others meet their end
in the bellies of hungry troggoths,
hunting Mawkrushas or packs of
emberwolves in the dark reaches.

Not all those that pledge the oath
perish soon after. Doomseekers who
continue to defeat their foes hone
their battle skills, sharpening them
to a razor’s edge. With each triumph
they are further imbued with the
energies of fell-handed Grimnir. It is
said of such Doomseekers that their
axes scorch the air with every swing,
and that they spit glowing cinders
with every war cry.

Doomseekers fight in much the
same style as Grimwrath Berzerkers,
although they are even more reckless
in their onslaught. Whirling,
gouging, and hacking, the doomed
warriors actually seem to grow
stronger and more frenetic the
longer the battle lasts and the more
injuries they sustain. When their
eyes blaze and the ki l ling truly takes

hold of them, some of their rampant
energy transfers from their clenched
fists into the fyresteel of their runic
war-iron. When it begins to glow as
if fresh from the forge, then is the
Doomseeker most dangerous. While
his axe cleaves, the war-iron rips out
chunks of flesh or is driven deep into
a foe’s vitals.

Doomseekers are fated to roam far
and wide in their quest for a worthy
death. During such sojourns they
are naturally drawn towards ur-gold,
for its latent power calls to them. It
is inevitable then that Doomseekers
chance upon Fyreslayer fyrds out
campaigning, for they too are pulled
towards the sacred substance. A few
of the most deranged Doomseekers
are so lustful for more power that
they see their fellow duardin as
foes, but most are willing to trade
their skills in battle in exchange for
fresh runes and the services of the
Runesmiters to drive them home.
Only death wi l l keep a Doomseeker
from eventually moving on in search
of his fate, but he wi l l settle any debts
before he departs once more.

Fyreslayer Infantry

FYRESLAYER INFANTRY

32

Like Grimnir, Fyreslayers are filled with fiery determination and an irascible belligerence. Smouldering in their
rage, Berzerkers charge headlong towards the foe bellowing ferocious war cries, while the Auric Hearthguard
stand their ground, channelling their aggression into volley after volley from their magmapikes.

Fyreslayer lodges are built upon a
foundation of skilled warriors and
martial pride. From these traditions
are born the Vulkite Berzerkers,
Hearthguard Berzerkers, and Auric
Hearthguard. All are oathsworn
to Grimnir, strong and resilient
fighters that have dedicated their
lives to battle. It is by their bloody
toil that enemies are hacked apart,
and mighty armies are broken. With
their fighting prowess the Fyreslayers
bring in ur-gold for their lodge,
either winning it in battle or earning
it as payment for mercenary deeds.

VULKITE BERZERKERS

When a lodge marches to war,
it is the Vulkite Berzerkers who
make up the bulk of its fyrds.
Heedless of enemy blows, they hurl
themselves into combat to strike
down their enemy, and nothing
less than a devastating wound wi l l
slow them down. Many are the
stories told across the realms of
Vulkite Berzerkers continuing to
slog through the fray, each stout
warrior bleeding from a score of
injuries. Even those with dozens of
arrows protruding from their flesh
press onwards, the light of Grimnir
burning in their eyes and their
fur y undimmed.

Some Vulkite Berzerkers fight with
a fyresteel axe in each hand, their
battlefield formation a terrible bladed
whirlwind of death and destruction.
Others eschew axes in favour of a
war-pick and bladed slingshield.
These ornate bucklers are far from
being purely defensive; a Berzerker
can hurl his shield at his target as
he bears down upon them. Soon
after,
in the maelstrom of the melee,
the duardin wi l l reclaim it, ripping
the shield out of his victim’s
ruined
corpse. For ranged capability, many
Berzerkers carr y finely balanced
throwing axes. After countless hours
of practice, a warrior can clip an ear
off a running grot at twenty paces
with but a flick of his wrist.

To prepare themselves for the holy
ritual of battle, Vulkite Berzerkers
perform many different rites. These
vary by lodge, and include such things
as ceremonial tattooing, scarification,
beard braiding, and coating hair
crests with a range of unpleasant
concoctions to maintain their rigidity.
Often these customs coincide with
grundtogg, the Fyreslayer word for
the ritual of a Runesmiter hammering
ur-gold runes into their bodies. The
fiercest and most experienced warrior
of a Vulkite Berzerker formation is
known as its Karl, and it is he that
oversees his brethren’s observances.

‘Let oaths be taken,

And shields be shattered.

We return with victory,

And axes besplattered.’

- Berzerker’s battle-song

In battle, the Vulkite Berzerkers
are consumed with a fierce joy. This
state of exhilaration is kindled into a
raging inferno by the chanting of the
Runesmiters, for the priests’ ancient
words and violent oaths set ur-gold
and duardin hearts alike aflame.
As disciples of Grimnir,
the Vulkite
Berzerkers seek to smite their foes
as did their vengeful god. When the
sonorous blare of a horn of Grimnir
sounds, to them it is as though
the booming voice of their deity
is calling a challenge to their foes,
driving the duardin to ever greater
heights of zeal and fury.

HEARTHGUARD
BERZERKERS

Hearthguard Berzerkers are the
elite melee specialists of the lodge.
In battle,
it is they who are given the
weighty honour of protecting the
royal family,
the Auric Runefather
and his Runesons, willing ly
sacrificing their own lives if
necessary to ensure the continuation
of their lord’s
legacy.

Each lodge regularly holds their
own version of ceremonial combat.
These brutal events are not only
a chance for the Fyreslayers to
venerate Grimnir, but also a proving
ground for the lodge’s warriors.
Hearthguard Berzerkers are chosen
from the Vulkite ranks based on raw
strength, fighting prowess, the ability
to channel Grimnir’s supernatural
might, or some combination thereof.
Those selected must pass the Trials
of Grimfyre, a series of endeavours
that test a duardin’s
loyalty to his
liege, and pit him against hulking
monsters and ferocious beasts.
Those who survive swear a profound
oath to the Runefather, who in turn
gifts the warrior with a fire-blessed
weapon from his personal hoard.

It is tradition for a Hearthguard
Berzerker to fight with either a
Berzerker broadaxe – a double-
handed axe capable of chopping
a limb off an ogor with a single
blow – or a flamestrike poleaxe,
a long-hafted weapon to which is
attached a chain capped with a heavy
flanged brazier. Lit with the flames
of the master forge, the brazier
swings in deadly arcs, breaking
bones and setting foes alight. Despite
the size and heft of these weapons,
Hearthguard Berzerkers wield them
as if they were extensions of their
own bodies.

Before battle, a Hearthguard
Berzerker formation’s Karl
leads
them in the taking of oaths. Each
renews his pledge to protect his
leaders, fighting for them as if he
were an honour guard for Grimnir
himself. Such is their fanaticism that,
when in combat near their lords,
Hearthguard Berzerkers can shrug
off seemingly mortal injuries, their
blazing battle-lust allowing them
to ignore great rents in their flesh
as they concentrate relentlessly on
hacking their foes apart. Only when
he is certain that his charge is safe
wi l l a warrior so wounded allow
himself join his ancestors.

AURIC HEARTHGUARD

The Auric Hearthguard are the
protectors of the forge-temple, the
dedicated soldiery of the Zharrgrim
priesthood. Each is sworn to protect
the forge fires, to preserve the sparks
originating from Brokkfoor,
the
Father of Forges.

The Runemaster too recruits from
the ranks of Vulkites, but he seeks
not the boldest of fighters, but rather
the most steady and incorruptible.
All Fyreslayers are warriors, with
loyalty to kin deeply ingrained into
their psyches, so these are traits
that require no searching. However,
hot tempers are common amongst
the followers of Grimnir, and as
their very name implies, Berzerkers
are prone to letting their lust for
battle or vengeance outweigh
common sense.

people’s god. Such a monumental
task can only be entrusted to
warriors who wi l l hold their ground,
no matter the circumstances. They
cannot lose themselves in the heat
of battle, nor allow themselves to be
drawn away from their holy duty.

Auric Hearthguard are steadfast, but
as Fyreslayers they are still naturally
belligerent. What marks these
warriors out from their brethren,
however,
is that they possess the
iron wi l l required to channel their
battle-fury not into reckless charges
at the foe, but into focussing the fire
of their trademark weapons.

Those chosen for the ranks of the
Auric Hearthguard stand watch
over their lodge’s
forge-temple and
treasure vaults. There the sacred
fires are kept, and the ur-gold that is
literally a shattered portion of their

The Auric Hearthguard carr y
magmapikes, bladed hand-cannons
that fire sizzling bolts of lava. Such
missiles are capable of searing
through plate armour, and the heat
of the shot can ignite the target’s hair

and clothing. Should any enemies
survive a sustained volley of these
fiery projectiles and manage to close
with the Auric Hearthguard,
they
are met with stubborn warriors
adept at slashing and stabbing with
the blades affixed to the heads and
hilts of these distinctive weapons.

Larger foes struck but not slain by
shots from a magmapike find the
movement of their limbs restricted as
the burning rock cools and solidifies
upon their flesh. This technique
has proven particularly effective at
pacifying rampaging Magmadroths,
for the creatures are unaffected by
the heat of the shot, but eventually
find themselves overwhelmed
by the oppressive weight of the
hardening lava.

When Fyreslayer lodges march to
war,
it is common for Hearthguard
formations to accompany them. In
the fyrds, they serve as bodyguards
to members of the Zharrgrim
priesthood, and Battlesmiths tell
many tales of their defiant stands
against numerically superior forces.

WARRIORS OF FORTUNE

Fulfil your oaths and unleash your fur y! There are many ways to go about collecting a Fyreslayer force so that you
too can gather ur-gold. To give you an idea of the thought process behind assembling an army, this spread shows
an example collection, alongside notes explaining which units were chosen and why.

There is no right or wrong way to
collect a Warhammer Age of Sigmar
army, however it does help to have
a plan. How you decide which units
to include in your Fyreslayer fyrd
might be based on the look of the
models, how you envision them
fighting in a tabletop battle, or it
could follow a narrative found in a
battletome or even one of your own
invention. No matter the method,
the goal is the same: to field a battle-
ready Fyreslayer army! What follows
here is some of the thinking behind
how we assembled the collection
photographed below.

The first model chosen for the
fyrd was the Auric Runefather,
patriarch of the lodge and leader of
the fyrd. Mounted on an enormous
Magmadroth, this warrior-king
is a force to be reckoned with on
the battlefield. Additionally,
the
massive model is a great centrepiece
and really stands out from the
infantry-heavy army, providing a
visual spectacle and some unique
painting challenges.

Not stopping there, we selected two
additional heroes on Magmadroths.
First, the Auric Runeson on his

enormous mount is able to get
into combat swiftly and hit hard, a
tactic true to his hot-headed nature
in the background and useful to
wrongfoot an enemy from the start.
The Runesmiter on Magmadroth,
meanwhile, can augment other units
in the army whilst being a powerful
model in its own right.

The Runemaster gives the fyrd access
to powerful magmic invocations,
and can open up geysers of lava
beneath the enemy’s feet or make use
of the Magmic Battleforge to extend
Grimnir’s battle-blessings.


PAGEBREAK
47

Three more champions,
this time
on foot, round out the characters
in the army. A Battlesmith is a
must, partially for his excellent
unit-boosting rules, but equally
because carr ying the icon of Grimnir
into the thick of the fight seems
like a very Fyreslayer thing to do!
The Doomseeker and Grimwrath
Berzerker are nasty surprises for the
foe, for each is a combat monster
capable of blasting out a lot of fierce
attacks as he smoulders with the
battle-spirit of his fallen god.

Next comes the bulk of the fyrd’s
numbers. Three units of Vulkite
Berzerkers wi l l storm the foe, each
warrior swinging a pair of fyresteel
axes. That’s an impressive number of
attacks, which wi l l all greatly benefit
from the presence of the Runesmiter
and Battlesmith.

Three small units of Auric
Hearthguard provide the fyrd
with much-needed ranged attacks,
and can be interspersed with the
Vulkite Berzerkers. Finally, an elite
unit – the Hearthguard Berzerkers
– form a hard-hitting bodyguard to
accompany the Runeson on his bold
rush into the foe.

If you look more closely at the
composition of our army, you wi l l
notice that three different warcroll
battalions (pg 75) can be formed
from the units we have included:
the Lords of the Lodge, a Warrior
Kinband and a Forge Brethren
battalion. Each of these formations
of units grants the army impressive
cohesion on the tabletop, and
bestows some powerful additional
abilities. Now all we need to do is to
go out and win some ur-gold!

PAINTING YOUR FYRESLAYERS

PAINTING YOUR
FYRESLAYERS

Whether you have never painted a Citadel Miniature in your life or are a master of the brush with decades of
experience, the prospect of painting a Fyreslayer fyrd offers a unique and exciting challenge. On the following
pages you w i l l find stage-by-stage guides to get you started, with tips and examples from the experts.

Painting your models is highly
rewarding, and it is your brushwork
and colour choices that help bring
out the detail of each Citadel
Miniature. A single painted
Fyreslayer looks great, a finished
unit is still more impressive, and an
entire painted fyrd – linked together
by a shared colour scheme – is
nothing less than spectacular. There
is immense satisfaction in watching
an army grow rank by rank.

First off, there is no right or wrong
way to paint a miniature. Some
revel in lavishing detail upon their
models, rendering each figure a work
of art. Others take a more simplistic
approach, with basic paint jobs that
allow them to finish a large force
quickly. And, of course, there is a
middle ground, where more time
and attention are applied to key

figures such as heroes or monsters.
There is no one way to paint,
just the
way that works best for you. And
where better to tr y out your painting
techniques than on the Fyreslayers?
The short but powerful duardin
of the Fyreslayers have their own
unique aesthetic: fierce and battle-
scarred warriors whose appearance
is dominated by large axes, beards
and enormous hair crests.

Before painting your models, you’ ll
first need to assemble them. To begin
with, we recommend you follow the
advice given in the construction
booklet provided with your models.
Next, you can choose a paint scheme.
Many of the most famous lodges are
shown on the preceding pages and
in the art throughout this book, but
of course it is also possible to create
your own. Which lodge you choose

can influence your army’s character
as well as its abilities (see page 62-
65). All the colours you’ ll need can
be found in the Citadel Paint System,
a range of paints that takes the
guesswork out of painting.

Warhammer TV’s painting
tutorials have insights for
everyone, as they show you how
to paint Citadel Miniatures
from start to finish. The guides
are available for free on
games-workshop.com, and
can also be watched via the
Warhammer TV YouTube
channel. Why not take a
moment to check them out?

Rune of Farsight: Add 1 to hit rolls for attacks
made with Fyresteel Throwing Axes by friendly

FYRESLAYERS units.

Enhanced Effect: Add 1 to wound rolls for attacks
made with Fyresteel Throwing Axes by friendly

FYRESLAYERS units.

LODGES

Across the Mortal Realms dwell the different
lodges of
the Fyreslayers, each with their own distinct culture
and traditions.

If your army is a Fyreslayers army, you can give it a
lodge keyword. All FYRESLAYERS units in your army
gain that keyword. If a model already has a lodge
keyword,
it cannot gain another one, but this does
not prevent other units in your army from having a
different lodge keyword. You can either choose one of
the lodges listed below, or choose another lodge you’ve
read about or created yourself. If you choose one from
the list below, all units with that keyword benefit from
the extra abilities listed for that lodge on the page
indicated. If you choose a different lodge, simply pick
the lodge that most closely matches the nature of your
own lodge.

UR-GOLD RUNES

Ur-gold is a source of streng th for the Fyreslayers.
In battle a warrior’s runes are awakened, filling the
duardin with the blazing power of Grimnir.

At the start of your hero phase, you can activate one
of the following six ur-gold runes. To do so, state
which rune wi l l be activated and roll a dice. On a 1-5,
the rune has the standard effect. On a 6 it also has the
enhanced effect. The effect(s) of the rune lasts until the
start of your next hero phase.

Each ur-gold rune can only be activated once in each
battle, and no more than one can be activated at the
same time. Once you have used a rune, you can choose
a new one to use in your next hero phase, but you
cannot use the same one again.

Rune of Fury : You can re-roll hit rolls of 1 for attacks
made by friendly FYRESLAYERS units.
Enhanced Effect: Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of
melee weapons used by friendly FYRESLAYERS units.

Rune of Searing Heat: If the unmodified wound roll
for an attack made by a friendly FYRESLAYERS unit is
6, add 1 to the Damage characteristic of the weapon for
that attack.
Enhanced Effect: Roll a dice for each enemy unit
within 3" of any friendly FYRESLAYERS units when
this rune is activated; on a 2+ that enemy unit suffers 1
mortal wound.

Rune of Awakened Steel: Improve the Rend

characteristic of melee weapons used by friendly

FYRESLAYERS units by 1.

Enhanced Effect: Improve the Rend characteristic by a
further 1.

Rune of Fiery Determination: Add 1 to the Bravery

characteristic of friendly FYRESLAYERS units.
Enhanced Effect: Friendly FYRESLAYERS units do not
have to take battleshock tests.

Rune of Relentless Zeal: Add 2" to the Move

Magmic Invocations

MAGMIC INVOCATIONS

59

FYRESLAYERS PRIESTS in a

Fyreslayers army can summon
magmic invocations, each of which
is represented on the battlefield by
a model.

The warscrolls for three magmic
invocations are included in this
battletome (see pages 86-87).
Magmic invocation models in your
army are not set up on the battlefield
at the start of the game. Instead, a

FYRESLAYERS PRIEST from your

army can summon each to the
battlefield. To attempt to do so, you
must roll a dice for that PRIEST ;
this is called an invocation roll.
Each magmic invocation warscroll
explains the invocation roll required
and how the model is set up.

Unless noted otherwise, a magmic
invocation model cannot be attacked
or affected by spells or abilities;
it
is treated as a friendly model by all
armies for any other rules purposes.
In order to attempt to summon a
magmic invocation, you must have
a model for that magmic invocation
available that is not already in your

army and on the battlefield. For
example,
if you have two Zharrgron
Flame-spitter models in your army,
and both are on the battlefield, you
cannot attempt Summon Zharrgron
Flame-spitter again until at least
one of them has been removed from
the battlefield. A FYRESLAYERS
PRIEST cannot attempt to summon
more than one magmic invocation
in the same turn (even if they are
different models). In addition, if a

FYRESLAYERS PRIEST attempts to

summon a magmic invocation and
the invocation roll is not successful,
then no other FYRESLAYERS
PRIEST can attempt to summon the
same magmic invocation in that
hero phase.

Designer’s Note: Most magmic

invocations allow you to use
an ability if there is a ‘f r iendly

FYRESLAYERS PRIEST ’ nearby. Note

that if both players’ armies have a

FYRESLAYERS PRIEST within range,

then they can both use the ability
when it is their turn to do so, not just
the player whose PRIEST per formed
the invocation.

TEMPERAMENTAL
NATURE

At the end of each battle round you
must make a temperamental nature
roll for each magmic invocation on
the battlefield that you set up. To
make a temperamental nature roll,
roll a dice. Add 1 to the roll if there
are any friendly FYRESLAYERS
PRIESTS within 6" of that magmic
invocation. On a 1-3, that magmic
invocation is removed from
the battlefield.

MAGMIC INVOCATIONS
IN PITCHED BATTLES

Magmic invocations have Pitched
Battle profiles and a points cost.
By paying the magmic invocation’s
points cost, the player can use (and
re-use) one magmic invocation
model of the appropriate type in
the battle. A player cannot take the
same magmic invocation more than
once for their army, but can take
any number of different magmic
invocations (for example, you could
not take two Zharrgron Flame-
spitter magmic invocations).

Magmic Battleforge

MAGMIC BATTLEFORGE

A Fyreslayers army can include 1
Magmic Battleforge terrain feature
(see opposite). After armies are set
up, but before the battle begins, you
can set up the Magmic Battleforge
within 6" of a friendly FYRESLAYERS
PRIEST , wholly within your territory
and more than 1" from any other
terrain features. If both players can
set up a terrain feature after armies
are set up, they must roll off, and
the winner can choose the order in
which the terrain features are set up.

UNION OF FIRE AND FURY

The convergence of the spirit of Grimnir and Vulcatrix is never more
evident than in the emergence of a Magmic Battleforge. The ground
shimmers as the glowing furnace rises up from the molten blood of the
earth, summoned from the bowels of the realm by the invocations of
the Zharrgrim priesthood. It is as though they bring a living piece of
their forge-temple straight to the battlefield. Yet
the Magmic Battleforge
is not just for forging blades, for the smithy blazes with battle-spirit,
its
elemental heat igniting the ur-gold runes of the Fyreslayers, making
them pulse and glow with new-found power. Not only do the Magmic
Battleforges aid the children of Grimnir upon the field of combat, but as
the mercenary fyrds often find themselves on campaign far from hearth
and home, they serve vital a function in many of the most important
Fyreslayer rituals. After a battle, the forge’s flames are used to ignite the
pyres of honoured dead, and Runemasters can use it to shape new ur-
gold runes far from the forge-temple and keep the Zharrkhul alive.

The history of Magmic Battleforges is a strange one, for they appeared
sporadically in the early stages of the Fyreslayers’ development. During
the Age of Myth, such blazing symbols were rare, coming unbidden to
Runemasters or Runesmiters in great need during the largest of battles.
Their sudden and unexpected manifestation upon the battlefield sparked
many legends. Over the years, the Zharrgrim priests have better learned
to harness the forges’ magmic powers, but it was only in the aftermath
of the Shyish necroquake that these mystic furnaces could regularly be
summoned to aid the fyrds.

Vostarg

62

VOSTARG

The largest, most prolific and most honoured of Fyreslayer lodges is that of the Vostarg. They are considered
relentless and aggressive even by the standards of Grimnir’s followers. Although none can equal their record of
victories or, more importantly, their hoard of ur-gold, it is still never enough, as the lodge always strives for more.

Descendants of the last of the original
lodges to fall,
the Vostarg have since gone on to build a proud legacy.
They do not rest upon their laurels, however, as each
new generation is eternally driven to equal and best the
achievements of their forebears.

Although those of the Vostarg lodge are proud that no
other lodge has amassed more ur-gold than they,
it is the
fact that they have spent more of it that makes their eyes
blaze. The true way to honour Grimnir is not to hoard
such treasures, but rather to use them up in combat,
releasing their vital energies so that the duardin god
might be reborn before the final battle.

Bold and aggressive, the secret behind the Vostarg’s
victories has been their relentless method of attack. With
surprising speed and unflinching determination, their
fyrds surge forward to hew down their foe. Not until the
last enemy has stopped twitching do they relent.

The current Runefather, Bael-Grimnir, sits upon the
Fyrethrone in the magmahold of Furios Peak, but the
Vostarg’s power is spread much further, with dozens
of other holds scattered across Aqshy and several other
realms as well. From each of these strongpoints the
Vostarg march out, endlessly warring on their holy
mission to collect ur-gold and expend its power in battle.

ABILITIES
Fearsome Surge: With eyes blazing and sparks flying
from their beards, the warriors of the Vostarg rush
forwards in their eagerness to smite the foe.

Add 1 to charge rolls for VOSTARG units. In addition,
in your movement phase in the first battle round,
if you
declare a friendly VOSTARG unit wi l l run, do not make a
run roll. Instead, add 6" to the Move characteristic of all
models in that unit for that phase.

COMMAND TRAIT

A VOSTARG general must have this command trait
instead of one listed on page 54.

Fiery Endurance: While any foe still stands, there can be
no respite from the fury of Grimnir.

Friendly VOSTARG units wholly within 12" of this model
at the start of your movement phase can run in that
movement phase and still charge later in the same turn.

COMMAND ABILITY
Honour Our Ancestors: The Vostarg’s past is full of
triumphs and glory, and they feel a driving pressure to
match those peerless deeds of yore.

You can use this command ability at the start of the
combat phase. If you do so, pick a friendly VOSTARG
HERO. Until the end of that phase, add 1 to hit rolls for
attacks made by that HERO and friendly units of VULKITE

BERZERKERS and HEARTHGUARD BERZERKERS wholly

within 12" of that HERO. You cannot use this command
ability more than once per phase.

ARTEFACT OF POWER

must be given the Vosaxe.

Vosaxe: Forged with legendary Vostargi obsidian, this
formidable weapon is a mighty heirloom of the Vostarg.

At the start of the battle, pick one of the bearer’s melee
weapons. Improve that weapon’s Rend characteristic by 1.
In addition, if the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with that weapon is 6, add 1 to the Damage characteristic
of that weapon for that attack.

Greyfyrd

GREYFYRD

63

Over the ages, the warriors of the Greyfyrd lodge have fought both for and against nearly every other faction and
race in the Mortal Realms. They are battle-hardened, grim and notoriously bitter. Those of the Greyfyrd rather
infamously have no qualms whatsoever about warring for any who can meet their fee.

While other lodges speak proudly of their heritage and
boast of their Runesons that have left to establish new
lodges, such is not the case with the Greyfyrd. Of the
dark secrets of their past they do not speak, although
many other Fyreslayers are quick to point out how many
Greyfyrd scions have suffered the glimmerlust or gone
grimnyn. There are but two subjects that the Greyfyrd
willing ly discuss: mercenary jobs – for they eagerly hire
out their war services to any that meet their price – and
the long line of bold heroes that the lodge has produced.
Many of the greatest Fyreslayer warriors have come from
Greyfyrd, a fact that makes the lodge justifiably proud.

The Greyfyrd capital
is the great magmahold of the
Gateswold in Chamon, and its numerous Realmgates
give the lodge access to many lands. These pathways are
used to send out mercenary fyrds on campaigns across all
the Mortal Realms, so that the sooty black beards of the
Greyfyrd are recognised far and wide. Their reputation
for keeping oaths and delivering victories (if they are
paid) ensures that their axes are always in demand.

Such a lifestyle of constant war ensures that the Greyfyrd
are grudge-bearing, pragmatic and especially grizzled. To
them, the most gruelling battle that leaves them wounded
and weary is but ‘another day on the job’,
to be forgotten
after the next pint of magmalt ale.

ABILITIES
Spoils of Victory : Famed mercenaries, the Grey fyrd lodge
have countless treasures and ar tefacts stored within their
vaults, and many heroes worthy of wielding them.

You can choose 2 additional GREYFYRD HEROES from
your army to have artefacts of power.

COMMAND TRAIT

A GREYFYRD general must have this command trait
instead of one listed on page 54.

Battle-scarred Veteran: This warrior is known not only
to have survived battles against the direst of odds, but to
relish the challenge of fighting hordes of foes.

COMMAND ABILITY
Expert Cohesion: The heroes of Grey fyrd have fought
alongside each other for many years, and have developed
the uncanny ability to anticipate each other’s actions in
battle, allowing them to fight as one.

You can use this command ability in the combat
phase when a friendly GREYFYRD HERO is picked to
fight. Other friendly GREYFYRD HEROES that are not
mounted on a MAGMADROTH and are within 3" of that
HERO can fight immediately afterwards, before your
opponent gets the option to pick a unit to fight. Any
model that does so cannot fight again in that combat
phase unless an ability or spell allows them to fight more
than once.

Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of this general’s melee
weapons while there are 5 or more enemy models within
3" of this general.

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first GREYFYRD HERO to receive an artefact of
power must be given the Helm of Obsidia.

Helm of Obsidia: Gifted to the Grey fyrd lodge after they
held out against the Chaos forces besieging the Ninefold
Kingdoms of Obsidia, this helm grants its bearer a portion
of its legendary resilience.

Add 2 to the Wounds characteristic of the bearer.


PAGEBREAK
Hermdar

64

HERMDAR

Those of the Hermdar lodge have car ved out a powerful reputation as the slayers of tyrants and overthrowers of
oppression. As they hire themselves out as mercenaries less often, the Hermdar must scour the realms in search of
ur-gold that their fyrds can seize and hold.

Recognisable by their glowing fyresteel, Hermdar
warriors are well known across many kingdoms of Aqshy.
They are particularly familiar to those of the Great Parch,
as the Hermdar have been active in the long series of wars
fought to free those lands from the iron grip of Chaos.

Based out of the Adamantine Chain, the Hermdar can
often be found fighting the forces of the Ruinous Powers.
Since the loss of their first hold in the Salamander’s Spine,
the Hermdar have taken a particular loathing to despots.
In order to free or protect those oppressed by enslavers,
the Hermdar willing ly march to war even when there is
no hope of earning much, or sometimes any, gold. The
peculiarity of such unmercenary behaviour is poorly
received by the Fyreslayers of other lodges, who see such
charitable work as foolishness. Strong-willed and defiant,
those of the Hermdar lodge care nothing for the opinions
of others.

The Hermdar way of war is based on an initial aggressive
attack that seamlessly shifts into a fierce defence. It is this
approach that allows them to storm enemy strongholds
and then to protect the slaves they have freed. Such tactics
also come into play when they find and secure sources of
ur-gold. This is vital, as they cannot count on as steady an
income of gold for mercenary deeds as their rival lodges.

ABILITIES
Seize by Force: The warriors of Hermdar lodge assault
enemy positions with a fiery determination.

COMMAND TRAIT

A HERMDAR general must have this command trait
instead of one listed on page 54.

HERMDAR units wholly within enemy territory or wholly
within 12" of an objective do not take battleshock tests.

Warrior Indominate: This stoic warrior stands as solid
and unmoveable as a mountain.

COMMAND ABILITY

Skull-breakers and Oath-takers: Those of Hermdar are

renowned for the fury of their counter-attacks.

You can use this command ability at the start
of the combat phase. Pick 1 friendly HERMDAR

VULKITE BERZERKERS unit or 1 friendly HERMDAR
HEARTHGUARD BERZERKERS unit wholly within 12"

of a HERMDAR HERO. That unit fights at the start of that
combat phase, before the players pick any other units to
fight with in that combat phase.

Subtract 1 from wound rolls for attacks that target this
general and friendly HERMDAR units wholly within 12".

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first HERMDAR HERO to receive an artefact of power
must be given the Tyrant Slayer.

Tyrant Slayer : The blood of countless warlords stains this
mighty weapon of red-hot fyresteel.

Pick one of the bearer’s melee weapons. You can re-roll
wound rolls for attacks made with that weapon that
target an enemy HERO. In addition, if the unmodified hit
roll for an attack made with that weapon that targets an
enemy HERO is 6, that attack inflicts 1 mortal wound on
the target in addition to any normal damage.

Lofnir

LOFNIR

65

The Lofnir are zealous pyromaniacs from Ghur. They are fierce and merciless oath-keepers who believe that a
battle is only over when every single foe has been given to the flames. In addition to cal ling out praises to Grimnir,
the Zharrgrim priests and warriors of the lodge cal l upon his ancient nemesis, Vulcatrix.

Those of the Lofnir lodge never do anything by half
measures. They do not just break enemy strongholds, they
burn them out,
leaving behind only scorched ruin. They
are as fierce as they are reckless.

While many lodges give great respect to Vulcatrix,
viewing the godbeast as a foe worthy of Grimnir,
the Lofnir lodge actually venerate the Mother of
Salamanders. Led by their Zharrgrim priests, they have
come to see ur-gold not as the shattered remnants solely
of their broken god, but as the blessed merging of the fiery
temper and battle-spirit of Grimnir with the magmic
strength of Vulcatrix.

None can best the Lofnir in the finding of Magmadroth
eggs or the raising of the creatures themselves, and
they boast some of the largest and most ferocious
Magmadroths in any of the realms. The proud and
ancient bloodlines of the creatures are as venerated as that
of the lodge’s
royal family.

The largest of the Lofnir magmaholds is Rufhal, a massive
hold built into a volcano called Crownpeak, so named
due to the permanent mantle of flame that burns above its
domed summit. This is just a sample of the mastery over
magic forces displayed by the Zharrgrim priests of Lofnir,
who truly are blessed by Vulcatrix.

ABILITIES

Venerators of Vulcatrix: The warriors of Lofnir hold

great esteem for Vulcatrix and her offspring.

Each MAGMADROTH in a LOFNIR army,

instead of only
1, can be given a Magmadroth trait (pg 57).

In addition, if you are fighting a Pitched Battle, you can
include 1 additional Behemoth in your army, as long as
every Behemoth in your army is a MAGMADROTH .

COMMAND ABILITY
Torrent of Magma: As a Lofnir Zharrgrim priest shouts
fiery oaths at his foes, blazing streaks of molten rock rain
down upon the enemy, reducing them to smouldering ash.

COMMAND TRAIT

A LOFNIR general must have this command trait instead
of one listed on page 54.

Explosive Charge: At their leader’s command, Lofnir
Magmadroths
loose mighty roars and erupt forwards in a
ferocious charge towards the enemy.

Add 1 to charge rolls for friendly LOFNIR
MAGMADROTHS within 12" of this general.

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first LOFNIR MAGMADROTH HERO to receive an

artefact of power must be given the Igneous Battle-
throne.

You can use this command ability in your shooting
phase. If you do so, pick an enemy unit within 12" of a
friendly LOFNIR PRIEST . Until the end of that phase,
add 1 to hit and wound rolls for attacks made with
Magmapikes by friendly units that target that enemy
unit. The same unit cannot be picked to be affected by
this command ability more than once per phase.

Igneous Battle-throne: Carved from magmatic rock and
embedded with sacred runes of Grimnir,
this throne’s aura
protects the bearer and his mount from harm.

Roll a dice each time you allocate a wound or mortal
wound to the bearer. On a 6+ that wound or mortal
wound is negated.

Battleplan: Ignite the Master Forge

66

BATTLEPLAN

IGNITE THE MASTER FORGE

Deep in Shyish, amidst the
foreboding peaks of the
Greyspears, can be found many
abandoned magmaholds. These
forsaken places have lain in ruin
since the Time of Tribulations,
when it is said the malign spirits
of the Nighthaunts fell upon them,
snuffed out their great forges and
slaughtered those who dwelt there.
Who now resides in these tombs,
none can say, but with hushed
whispers Fyreslayers speak of the
riches that remain untouched
within the lost forge-temples and
great vaults.

This battle tells the tale of an
intrepid Fyreslayer warband who
dream of reigniting a master forge,
restoring a lost magmahold to its
former glory and perhaps claiming
some ur-gold for their own.

THE ARMIES

Each player picks an army as
described in the core rules. One
player is the Fyreslayers player and
their opponent is the Desecrator
player. The Fyreslayers player must
use a Fyreslayers army. In addition,
you wi l l need a Magmic Battleforge
to represent the forge-temple’s
master forge.

Each army has a unique command
ability, as follows.

FYRESLAYERS
COMMAND ABILITY

Redeem Our Ancestors: Now is the

chance to settle a grudge that has
gone unanswered for generations.
With a bellowing war cry, this hero
charges his foe.

You can use this command ability at
the start of the combat phase. Pick a

friendly FYRESLAYERS HERO within

12" of the master forge. You can re-
roll wound rolls for attacks made by
friendly FYRESLAYERS units wholly
within 12" of that HERO until the
end of that phase.

DESECRATOR
COMMAND ABILITY

These Tunnels are Ours!: With a

terrible howl that echoes up through
hidden tunnels and chambers, this
warlord summons reinforcements
into the fray.

You can use this command ability
at the end of your movement phase.
Pick a friendly unit (that is not a
HERO) that has been destroyed.
Set up that unit at fu l l strength
anywhere on the battlefield more
than 9" from any enemy units.

THE BATTLEFIELD

The battlefield represents a
desecrated Fyreslayer magmahold.
Place four objectives as shown on
the map below. These markers each
represent a forge fire brazier. A
Magmic Battleforge is placed in the
centre of the battlefield to represent
the master forge of the magmahold.
During this battle, do not use
the scenery rules on the Magmic
Battleforge’s warscroll.

SET-UP

The Desecrator player sets up
their army first. The Desecrator
player’s units must be set up wholly
within their territory and more
than 12" from enemy territory. The
Fyreslayers player then sets up their
army wholly within their territory.
Note that the Fyreslayers army
cannot include a Magmic Battleforge
of its own.

hero phase, they can make one
attempt to ignite the master forge if
there are any friendly FYRESLAYERS
HEROES within 3" of it. Roll a dice.
On a 6+, the master forge is ignited.
Add 1 to this roll for each forge fire
brazier that has been rekindled.
Subtract 1 from this roll for each
enemy PRIEST or WIZARD within 6"

IGNITING THE
MASTER FORGE
If the master forge’s flames can be
ignited once more, the Fyreslayers
will have fulfilled their oath,
honouring their ancestors and
restoring glory to the magmahold.

GLORIOUS VICTORY

The battle ends and the Fyreslayers
player wins a major victor y if the
master forge is ignited. If the master
forge is not ignited by the end of the
fifth battle round, the battle ends
and the Desecrator player wins a

major victory.

DARKEST DEPTHS
The magmahold lies in ruin. Its once
proud halls and tunnels are partially
collapsed and dangerous creatures
lurk in the shadows.

This battle uses the Darkest
Depths rules (see page 298 of the
Core Book).

Battleplan: Honour Our Oaths

68

BATTLEPLAN

HONOUR OUR OATHS

It is not always the pursuit of
ur-gold that sees a Fyreslayers
army muster for war, for they have
many hated enemies. Lodges also
march out from their magmaholds
to uphold oaths, no matter how
ancient. Such vows are bonds of
iron, and duardin w i l l risk their
lives to honour them.

This battleplan tells the tale of
one such oath. Despite a besieged
city having naught to offer, a band
of Fyreslayer heroes have sworn
to protect it. For thirty days and
thirty nights have these proud
warriors beaten back the enemy.
Enraged by failure, the enemy
warlord now marches on the city
in person. For the few remaining
heroes of the lodge, to slay the
enemy leader w i l l honour their
oath, and allow them to return to
their magmahold at last.

THE ARMIES

Each player picks an army as
described in the core rules.
One player is the Fyreslayers
player and their opponent is the
Besieger. The Fyreslayers player
must use a Fyreslayers army and
each unit in their army must be a

FYRESLAYERS HERO.

Each army has a unique command
ability, as follows.

FYRESLAYERS
COMMAND ABILITY

Blaze of Glory : Each of these heroes
continues fighting long after their
wounds should have killed them.

The Fyreslayers player can use this
command ability when a friendly

FYRESLAYERS HERO is slain within

3" of an enemy unit. If you do so,
before that model is removed from
play,
it can immediately make a pile
in move and then attack with all of
the melee weapons it is armed with.
If the model has already fought in
that combat phase, it can do so a
second time. Once its attacks have
been resolved, remove the model
from play as normal.

BESIEGER COMMAND ABILITY

Display of Dominance: The warriors

under this warlord’s
command
fear the Fyreslayers’ champions,
and tell tales of their ferocity and
mar tial prowess. To lift the severed
head of one in battle shows they are
but mor tals, to be crushed like any
other foe.

resulted in an enemy HERO being
slain that phase. If they do so, until
the end of that phase, they can
re-roll hit rolls for attacks made by
friendly units wholly within 18" of
your general.

MIGHTY HEROES
OF GRIMNIR
The surviving warriors of the lodge
are the most fearsome of all. Each has
carved a glorious legacy, and bears
the most power ful ar tefacts.

Each FYRESLAYERS HERO in

the Fyreslayers player’s army
may take an artefact of power,
and each MAGMADROTH in the
Fyreslayers player’s army may take a
Magmadroth trait.

SET-UP

The Fyreslayers player sets up their
army first. The Fyreslayers player’s
units must be set up wholly within

BIDING THEIR TIME
The city lies besieged, and for those

up to the invading warlord now to
choose the right time to strike.

At the start of the first battle round,
the Besieger rolls on the weather
table above to determine the weather
that affects the battle. The Besieger
can re-roll the dice any number of
times; however, each time they do
so the Fyreslayers player receives 1
command point.

BREAKING THE DEFENCE
The last few Fyreslayers guard the
ruined gates to the city. Beyond,
treasures lie ready to be plundered.

Mark a point at the centre of the
Fyreslayers player’s long table edge,
to indicate the broken city gates. At
the start of the Besieger player’s hero
phase, any units from the Besieger
player’s army that are wholly within
6" of that point and more than 3"
from any enemy units can enter the
city. Remove the models in those
units from play, but do not count
them as being slain.

GLORIOUS VICTORY

The Besieger player wins a major

city. If the Besieger player’s general
is slain, the Fyreslayers player wins

PATH TO GLORY

PATH TO GLORY

70

Path to Glory campaigns centre around collecting and fighting battles with a warband in the Age of Sigmar.
Champions fight each other and gather followers to join them in their quest for glory, taking advantage of this age
of unending battle to win glory and renown.

In order to take part in a Path to
Glory campaign, you wi l l need two
or more players. All players wi l l
need to have at least one HERO,
who is their champion, and must
then create a warband to follow and
fight beside their champion during
the campaign.

The players fight battles against each
other using the warbands they have
created. The results of these battles
wi l l gain their warband favour. The
warband wi l l swell in numbers as
more warriors flock to their banner,
while existing troops become
more powerful.

After gaining enough favour or
growing your warband enough to
dominate all others through sheer
weight of numbers, you wi l l be
granted a final test. Succeed, and
your glory wi l l be affirmed for all
time, and you wi l l be crowned as the
victor of the campaign.

CREATING A WARBAND

When creating a Path to Glory
warband, do not select your army in
the normal manner. Instead, your
army consists of a mighty champion
battling to earn the favour of the
gods, and their entire band of loyal
followers. As you wage war against
other warbands, your own warband
wi l l grow, and existing units wi l l
become grizzled veterans.

WARBAND ROSTER

The details and progress of each
warband need to be recorded
on a warband roster, which
you can download for free
from games-workshop.com.

To create a warband, simply follow
these steps and record the results on
your warband roster :

the warband and the rewards they
can receive for fighting battles.
The warband tables included in
this battletome let you collect
a warband with the Fyreslayers
allegiance, but other Warhammer
Age of Sigmar publications include
warband tables to let you collect
other warbands from the Grand
Alliances of Order, Chaos, Death
and Destruction.

start with a Follower’s Reward.
No champion or unit can start the
Path to Glory campaign with more
than one reward each.

6. Finally,
give your warband a
name, one that wi l l inspire respect
and dread in your rivals. Your
warband is now complete, and
you can fight your first battle.
Good luck!

2. Next, choose your warband’s
champion by selecting one of the
options from your allegiance’s
champion table. The champion
you choose wi l l determine the
number of followers in your
warband. Give your champion a
suitably grand name, and write
this down on your warband roster.

3. Having picked your champion,
the next step is to generate your
starting followers. These can
be chosen from the followers
tables for your allegiance. If your
allegiance has more than one
followers table you can freely
choose which ones you use,
selecting all of your followers
from a single table or from several.
Instead of choosing, you can place
your destiny in the hands of fate
and roll on the followers tables
instead. To make a followers roll,
pick a column from one of the
followers tables and then roll
a dice.

4. Your
followers need to be
organised into units. The followers
table tells you how many models
the unit has. Follower units
cannot include additional models,
but they can otherwise take any
options listed on their warscroll.
Record all of the information
about your followers on your
warband roster.

TO WAR!

Having created a warband, you can
now fight battles with it against
other warbands taking part in the
campaign. You can fight battles as
and when you wish, and can use
any of the battleplans available for
Warhammer Age of Sigmar. There
are some battleplans, for example in

the General’s Handbook , that have

been designed specifically for use in
Path to Glory campaigns.

The units you use for a game must
be those on your roster. Units can
either be fielded at their fu l l roster
strength, or broken down into
smaller units, as long as no unit
is smaller than the minimum size
shown on its warscroll.

Any casualties suffered by a warband
are assumed to have been replaced
in time for its next battle. If your
champion is slain in a battle,
it is
assumed that they were merely
injured, and they are back to fu l l
strength for your next game, thirsty
for vengeance!

1. First, pick an allegiance for your
warband. Each allegiance has its
own set of warband tables that
are used to generate the units in

followers, your champion can start

GAINING GLORY

All of the players in the campaign
are vying for glory. The amount
of glory they have received is
represented by the Glory Points that
the warband has accumulated. Glory
can be increased by fighting and
winning battles, as described next.
As a warband’s glory increases, it
wi l l also attract additional followers,
and a warband’s champion may be
granted rewards.

Warbands receive Glory Points after
a battle is complete. If the warband
drew or lost the battle,
it receives 1
Glory Point. If it won the battle,
it
receives D3 Glory Points (re-roll a
result of 1 if it won a major victory).

Add the Glory Points you scored to
the total recorded on your roster.
Once you have won 10 Glory Points,
you wi l l have a chance to win the
campaign, as described opposite.

REWARDS OF BATTLE

Each allegiance has its own set of
rewards tables. After each battle you
can take one of the three following
options. Alternatively, roll a D3 to
determine which option to take:

D3 Option
1
Additional Followers: More

followers flock to your banner.
Either select a new unit or
roll for a random one from
a follower table, then add it
to your warband roster. You
can choose from any of your
own follower tables, or from
any of the follower tables
from an allied warband table
i.e. a warband table whose
allegiance is from the same
Grand Alliance as your own. In
either case, if you wish to add a
unit from a follower table that
requires more than ‘1 roll’, you
must also reduce your Glory
Points total by 1 (if you do not
have enough Glory Points,
you cannot choose a unit from
such a table). Once 5 new units
have joined your warband, you
wi l l have a chance to win the
campaign, as described below.

2

Champion’s Reward: Your

champion’s prowess grows. Roll
on your allegiance’s champion
rewards table. Note the result
on your warband roster. If you
roll a result the champion has
already received, roll again until
you get a different result.

3

Follower’s Reward: Your

warriors become renowned
for mighty deeds. Pick a unit
of followers (not one from an
allied warband table), then roll
on your allegiance’s
followers
rewards table. Note the result
on your warband roster. If you
roll a result the unit has already
received, roll again until you get
a different result.

ETERNAL GLORY

There are two ways to win a Path
to Glory campaign: either by Blood
or by Might. To win by Blood
your warband must first have 10
Glory Points. To win by Might
your warband must have at least
5 additional units of followers. In
either case, you must then fight
and win one more battle to win the
campaign. If the next battle you fight
is tied or lost, you do not receive
any Glory Points – just keep on
fighting battles until you either win
the campaign… or another player
wins first!

You can shorten or lengthen a
campaign by lowering or raising
the number of Glory Points needed
to win by Blood, or the numbers of
extra units that must join it to win
by Might. For example, for a shorter
campaign, you could say that a
warband only needs 5 Glory Points
before the final fight, or for a longer
one, say that 15 are needed.
