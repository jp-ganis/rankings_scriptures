The Storm Incarnate. The Living Tempest. The
Bringers of Revenge. Many are the names by
which the Stormcast Eternals are known, and
many are the warriors in their ranks. Yet
they
bear a single,
thunderous message upon the
winds of war: death to all who oppose Sigmar.

For too long have the Mortal Realms suffered
under the yoke of Chaos. Save those of Azyr,
every nation has been crippled, every city
besieged and every landscape tainted. Reality
itself
teeters on the brink, all but consumed by
the foulness of the Dark Gods.

Since the breaking of Sigmar’s Tempest,
the scions of Chaos have been hurled back
on a hundred fronts, and the seeds of new
civilisations planted in the lands reclaimed.
Martial, tribal, made for war,
the Stormcast
Eternals are terrifying foes, and their allies are
often as thunderstruck as their enemies by the
violence and slaughter they unleash.

No mortal warriors are these,
for they fight and
die without pause, only for their souls to be
mystically reforged in Azyr. Even in death they
find no peace,
instead being sent back into the
worst hellscapes imaginable to give their lives
over and over again.

For a time,
it seemed the endless tide of
darkness could be held back, and there were
those amongst
the Free Peoples who believed
that
the Stormcast Eternals represented an age
of hope that was there to stay. But then, the
constant cycle of death and reforging began to
take its toll on Sigmar’s chosen…

WARRIORS OF THE CELESTIAL TEMPEST

WARRIORS OF THE
CELESTIAL TEMPEST

The Stormcast Eternals are mortal heroes that have been transformed into supernatural warriors
in the forges of Azyr, each the embodiment of Sigmar’s storm. They are the God-King’s wrath
made manifest, and they were created for one single purpose: outright war!

The heavens roar and the sky
crashes, split by searing bolts
from above. With an explosion
of lightning and a booming
thunderclap,
the forces of the
Stormcast Eternals manifest in
reality and plunge into battle.
Energised by the magical
tempest, they launch their
attack, weapons wreathed
in celestial energy. Razor-
edged blades rise and fall, and
heavy hammers swing in an
onslaught that batters down all
before it. Theirs is the fur y of
the heavens unleashed.

Raised up by the God-King
from their former lives, the
Stormcast Eternals come from
every tier of society. Fiery
warrior kings fight shoulder-
to-shoulder with
stoic castellans
and bellicose

priests, each hand-chosen for
immortality after giving their
all against the armies of Chaos.
In glorious Sigmaron these
heroes are blasted apart upon
the Anvil of the Apotheosis
by the energies of Azyr,
to be
remade in a process called the
reforging. Those who survive
this leave their previous
incarnations behind – though
many struggle to hang on to
their former identity,
they all
become creatures of the storm.
Tall and broad-shouldered,
they are clad in gleaming
sigmarite, a metal stronger
than any steel. The frowning,
impassive masks that hide
their faces are feared across
the Mortal Realms, as are their
lightning-charged weapons
– tools of war that can smash
an orruk’s bones to pulp. For
those mortal folk saved from
disaster by the Stormhosts,
they are avenging angels
sent by a raging god.

Each Stormcast
Eternal
is able
to overcome a
dozen lesser men.
They do not fight as
individuals, however,
but go to battle in
massed ranks of infantry,
in echelons of heavy
cavalry,
in winged hosts
and in swift hunting parties,
all working in concert to
bring doom to the foe.

Because they are saturated
with the magic of Sigmar’s
storm, the Stormcast Eternals
can blaze into reality on bolts
of celestial force. Once a
Stormcast Eternal has taken
form within the other realms,
they cannot ascend
once more without

either passing through a portal
to Azyr or dying in battle.
When such a warrior is slain,
they are not truly lost. Their
body, weapons and armour
discorporate in a heartbeat,
transmuting into a crackling
cloud of energy that flashes
upwards in a blur. When this
soul-stuff reaches Azyr,
it is
drawn back to Sigmar’s vaults,
where it is eventually reforged
so that the Stormcast Eternal
might live again – and be sent
straight back into the fight.

A HIGH PRICE

The reforging process is
excruciatingly painful even if
it goes to plan, but it does not
always do so. With so many
dangers threatening the realms,
there is rarely time to ensure
each Stormcast’s
reforging
runs smooth. The mystical
transformation is impossibly
complex, and those who
undergo it often lose a part of
themselves in the process; each
time they return to Sigmar’s
forge, there is a chance they
wi l l emerge altered in mind
as well as in body. This is
troubling in the extreme for the
Stormcast Eternals – though
few admit it openly – for under
their shining battle armour
they are still in part human,
with all the hopes, fears and
ambitions that come with that
birthright. While for some
these changes are subtle, others
find their flaws rising to the
surface. Many Stormhosts, the
Celestial Vindicators foremost
amongst them, feel a burning
need to wreak revenge upon
those who enslaved their
people. Others have lightning
crackling from their eyes
when their ire is raised, or

thunder rumbling under their
words. Some fear that to be
reforged too many times is to
become one of the legendary
transfigured, a warrior so
changed that they are more
like a weapon than a human
being. Some fear the Stormcast
Eternals wi l l ultimately
relinquish their former
existences altogether, becoming
creatures of celestial energy
that are more than human and
far less at the same time.

THE GOD-KING

The Lord of the Storms, Sigmar
Heldenhammer is the most
powerful of mankind’s deities.
He is the Great Uniter,
the
God-King who presided over
the Grand Alliance of Order.
It is Sigmar who rules Azyr,
Realm of Heavens, and he who
created the Stormhosts. During
the cataclysm that shattered the
world-that-was, Sigmar fell into
darkness. Only by clutching
onto the last spinning remnant
of his world – the metallic core

later named Mallus – did he
escape oblivion.

Sigmar’s journey was long
and dark, but just as his sanity
was beginning to slip away, he
was found by Dracothion the
Great, Father of Stardrakes.
Many are the tales that recount
how Dracothion befriended
Sigmar, placing Mallus in the
firmament above the Realm
of Heavens. It was Dracothion
who showed Sigmar the Eight
Realms, and so began the era
known as the Age of Myth.

Over time, the races were
united under Sigmar’s rule, and
he seeded civilisation across
the Mortal Realms. Many
legends are told of Sigmar’s
deeds, such as when he felled
Ymnog, Grandfather of
Gargants, hunted down Great
Nagendra, the shape-shifting
realm-serpent, and fought the
greenskin god Gorkamorka.

Sigmar discovered and
awakened many other gods,

creating a pantheon over which
he ruled. Cities were founded
and societies flourished. Yet,
eventually,
the tendrils of
Chaos began to infect the
minds of mortals and sow strife
in every realm, bringing war
and plague, corruption and
ruin. The foibles of humans,
duardin and aelves allowed the
Dark Gods to gain footholds
everywhere. Their worship
spread,
leading to uprisings –
and, ultimately,
the invasions
of the daemon hosts.

After several long wars and
many defeats, Sigmar’s tenuous
pantheon was broken, forcing
the God-King to retreat to the
seclusion of Azyr and seal the
gates behind him. But he was
not beaten. Though he left the
people of the Mortal Realms
to fend for themselves against
the scourge of Chaos, he used
that time well, creating a
storm-born army to fight in the
crusades to come.

GHAL MARAZ

The tale of the warhammer Ghal Maraz – meaning ‘Skull-
Splitter’
in the ancient tongue – hails back to the world-that-
was. It was gifted to the God-King when he was still a young
mortal man by devotees of Grungni the Maker. Blessed with the
most potent rune-magic, the Great Shatterer has transcended its
material origins to become the symbol of a new age.

During the Age of Myth, Sigmar smote legendary monsters and
broke savage champions upon the hammer’s unyielding golden
face. When the legions of Chaos rose ascendant, cities fell before
the daemonic onslaught – but the minions of the Dark Gods
did not go unopposed. It was upon the Fireplains of Aqshy that
the God-King wielded Ghal Maraz against Archaon and his
daemon lords. Their combined armies dominated the horizon
and reached high into the sky – for the Chaos legions had torn
a rent in reality from which poured accursed spawn beyond
count. Thus began the Battle of Burning Skies. During that epic
battle the God-King was tricked by Tzeentchian illusion into
hurling Ghal Maraz not at Archaon, as he had intended, but into
a sorcerous portal. The hammer was lost, and the battle with it.

Centuries later, when Sigmar unleashed his Stormcast Eternals,
one of their first tasks was to find Ghal Maraz. In Anvrok the
hammer was found, and after a great battle returned to Sigmar’s
grip. But by then the God-King had transcended the battlefield.
He gave Ghal Maraz to his champion, the numinous Celestant-
Prime. Since then, it has reaped a greater tally than ever before.

Neither daemon nor mutant can withstand a concerted onslaught from Sigmar’s chosen. But even the Stormcast
Eternals cannot be everywhere at once. In Ghyran’s green swathe, the City of Seven Bells was overrun by the
forces of Nurgle. It was brought to the brink of ruin before a determined counter-attack claimed it once more.

IN SIGMAR’S NAME

IN SIGMAR’S NAME

Over the course of their training, the Stormcast Eternals had been taught that there was nothing
they could not overcome with sword, hammer, and lightning. The breaking of Sigmar’s Tempest
upon the realms, and the era of constant battle thereafter, was to test that supposition to the limit.

The sealed portals to the Realm
of Heavens were impenetrable,
and Sigmaron remained
safe from the all-conquering
armies. The ravenous hunger
of the Dark Gods could not be
sated, for they would be content
with nothing less than the
total conquest of every Mortal
Realm. The early daemonic
invasions were horrific, but
after Sigmar shut himself away
in Azyr they became far worse.
A deep and terrible darkness
fell over the realms, for the Age
of Chaos had arrived.

By attacking and controlling
the Realmgates – mystic portals
that allow travel between the
different realms – the Chaos
forces cut off and dominated
all who opposed them. One by
one, the greatest civilisations
were pulled down into ruin.
Some fell to sword and fire,
others to plague or decadent
corruption from within.

Warped creatures crept from
the shadows to live amongst
the rubble of toppled nations,
whispering to the huddled and
desperate survivors that their
gods had abandoned them,
but that they could still regain
their former glory. Some of
the broken bands of people
resisted, though the majority
of these were slain or enslaved.
Others began to worship the
Chaos Gods, swearing dark
vows and joining grotesque
rituals. Across the realms,
abhorrent monuments rose to
the skies, and fell fortresses
were constructed atop the
old ruins. The Chaos forces
grew so powerful the lands
themselves changed under their
corrupting influence.

The Dark Gods, sure of
victory yet always grasping for
more, began to fight amongst

themselves, each striving to
be the sole conqueror of the
realms. They waxed and waned
in power and ascendancy as
their plots came to fruition.
Khorne, the Blood God;
Nurgle, God of Plagues; and
Tzeentch, Master of Sorcery –
each controlled lands untold.
Slaanesh, the Dark Prince
of Excess, was mysteriously
missing, although his minions
were ruthless in their search
for the absent deity. Even the
Great Horned Rat, god of the
skaven, claimed vast kingdoms.
It was Khorne, however, who
emerged as the most powerful
of all. Everywhere his armies
ran rampant, mercilessly
slaughtering all they found,
and the lands ran red with the
blood of the mortal races.

Though his need for vengeance
simmered hot, the God-King
spent as long as he could in
preparation before sending
forth his Tempest – for he knew
he would have but one chance
at redemption. Over the course
of the Long Wait, he founded
armies so extensive even the
vast halls of the Sigmarabulum
were packed to capacity at
times. When Sigmar saw that
reality itself was crumbling
away, he gathered the legions
he had forged thus far in great
ceremony, and bade them get
ready for war. Though he did
not admit his doubts to any
save his ancient ally Grungni
the Maker, he feared the
Stormcast Eternals were not
ready,
that his grand design
was not complete. Already he

suspected that the reforging
process he had designed
to make them immortal
contained a small but vital flaw,
though he could not say how
it might manifest. Even his
celestial vision was not infinite,
and he could not read the fates.
But the Dark Gods had left him
little choice – the Stormcast
Eternals had to be sent forth.

When Sigmar finally unleashed
his Tempest across the Mortal
Realms, the Stormcast Eternals
struck the minions of the
Dark Gods with such force the
shock waves were felt across
the lands. A new and righteous
chapter began in the history of
the Mortal Realms – the Age
of Sigmar.

Just as their foes had done
during those first bloody
years of the Age of Chaos, the
Stormcast Eternals struck at
the Realmgates, seeking to
isolate the Chaos forces. Thus
began the Realmgate Wars
and, for the first time, the tide
began to turn. What followed
were mighty battles the likes of
which had not been seen since
the Red Century.

At the Igneous Delta of Aqshy’s
Great Parch, the Hammers of
Sigmar made war against the
Goretide, thousands dying each
day. In Chamon, the Stormcast
Eternals stormed the Eldritch
Fortress and reclaimed Ghal
Maraz for their master. Allies
thought long lost returned to
Sigmar’s banner, given hope
by the appearance of this new
force in the realms. Among
them was Alarielle, the nature
goddess of Ghyran, and her
arboreal Sylvaneth legions.
Though Nurgle’s cloying grip
was suffocating the Realm of
Life with decay, with the aid of
the Hallowed Knights, Alarielle

was able to assume her war
aspect and fight back. This was
a turning point in the battle
for the Jade Kingdoms, and a
great blow against the forces
of Chaos.

The arrival of the Stormcast
Eternals at first drove the
servants of the Dark Gods
into disarray,
their daemonic
masters caught off-guard by
the fur y of Sigmar’s wrath.
But, over time, those fell
armies gathered for a new
assault under Archaon the
Everchosen – greatest general
of the Chaos Gods. Both
sides enlisted or enslaved the
zodiacal monstrosities known
as godbeasts to aid them in

their cause. Ignax the Solar
Drake, Behemat the World
Titan, even Dracothion himself
– all were drawn into the fray.
Cataclysmic battles ensued, and
the lands of the Mortal Realms
were in places altered forever.

The servants of Chaos, swollen
with power after an age of
slaughter and conquest, proved
deadly foes, and many noble
warriors were sent back to Azyr
upon the storm. Though the
Stormcast Eternals were to all
intents and purposes immortal,
they were immune to neither
blade nor spell. When they fell
in battle their bodies could be
remade, but each new reforging
stripped them of a little more of
their humanity.

The Realmgate Wars reached
their climactic conclusion
as Sigmar attempted to take
back the Allpoints – a nexus
of Realmgates that allowed
passage to all realms – from
Archaon’s armies. In a final

tumultuous showdown before
the great fortresses known as
the All-gates – within which
the Realmgates leading to the
Allpoints were to be found –
Sigmar and the armies of Order
were able to recover two vital
portals – the Genesis Gate in
Ghyran and the Brimfire Gate
of Aqshy.

At great cost, the forces of
Sigmar claimed valuable
territories across the realms,
establishing new outposts
and raising cities that stand
tall and proud to this day. But
this hard-fought frontier is
far from secure. The hosts of
Chaos strike back daily against
their hated foes, the greenskin
tribes have been roused to fresh
heights of savage fur y by the
escalating conflict, and the
legions of Nagash haunt every
dark corner. Meanwhile, the
Stormhosts must now face the
dangers within themselves that
cannot be fought with blade
and hammer.

LIFE AND DEATH EVERLASTING

Sigmar had struck hard at the Dark Gods, ripping away control of much of Aqshy and Ghyran,
as well as establishing pockets of civilisation throughout the realms. But whilst his rage seared
blinding hot against the hosts of Chaos, he had allowed other fell powers to rise in the darkness.

Over the course of the Long
Wait – that period in which
Sigmar marshalled his strength
in Azyr – the Stormcast
Eternals trained tirelessly in
the Gladitorium, mastering
the techniques of war. They
fought singly,
in phalanxes,
in
spear-tip assaults and in great
shield walls that seemed more
castle than army. But that godly
arena, given unto Sigmar by
Malerion, the Shadow King,
was as much illusion as it was
reality, and those cut down

‘We have achieved much, we

there did not die true deaths.
The mettle of the Stormcast
Eternals was not truly tested
until they were unleashed for
the first time into the Mortal
Realms – and nor was the
process of reforging. When
the Stormcasts finally met the
Chaos hosts they had been
created to fight, they faced not
only the physical challenge
of war, but also a test of their
eternal souls.

The artifice that had lit a spark
of immortality in the soul
of each Stormcast was not
beyond the power of Sigmar to
bestow, but doing so on such
a vast, industrialised scale
had never been attempted
before. The long and arduous
process strained the Heavens
themselves and, for a while,
taxed every mote of celestial
magic under the God-King’s
command. Though Sigmar did
not admit it, he had not fully
mastered the grand cycle of
reforging by the time he sent
the first waves of Stormcast
Eternals into battle. A small
seed of doubt, in the darkest
of nights, raised qualms that
perhaps he never would – for
Sigmar was a warrior at heart,
not a supreme sorcerer like his
distant ally Teclis, or a master
of spirits like his rival god
Nagash. The sheer potency of
his creations could be denied by
no one, but as for the sanctity
of the soul that burned inside,
not even the God-King himself
could be sure unless he himself
presided over the remaking.

Sigmar knew that the continual
cycle of death and rebirth
would take its toll on the
Stormhosts, but it did not
stay his hand. Given that his
grand strategy was to unfold
across not only Azyr, but on
battlefields in every other

Mortal Realm, he could not
possibly oversee every iteration
of each soul that fought in his
crusades. It was a flaw in his
divine process that caused him
great consternation, so much so
that at times his countenance
became etched with the cares
of the Mortal Realms and his
hair streaked with white as
the weight of aeons bore down
upon him.

But Sigmar is no fool. He knew
fu l l well that the laws of the
cosmos could not be completely
bound to his will, but he would
not give up. Just as he had long
ago realised that he could not
win the war against Chaos
by fighting every battle in
person – and thus had created
armies of heroes to fight on his
behalf – he created a legion of
Stormcast Eternals specifically
to guard in his stead the souls
of those who would be reforged
so frequently in the years to
come. Their duty was to watch
over each reforging process,
from the Cairns of Tempering
to the legendary Anvil of the
Apotheosis, and see to those
souls who did not fare well
enough in that process to rejoin
their Stormhosts and the battle
for the Mortal Realms. So did
the Sacrosanct Chambers,
those most secretive and arcane
of all Sigmar’s hosts, come
into being.

To bring about the creation
of this eldritch brethren,
Sigmar took the souls of
those powerful wizards and
priests from across the realms
that had defied the scourge
of Chaos. Over the course of
their reforging, each of their
essences was bathed in the light
of the High Star Sigendil, which
imbued within them a measure
of Sigmar’s heavenly power
over the noble soul.

11

The warrior-mystics of the
Sacrosanct Chambers quickly
learned the arts of arcane
guardianship. Sigmar had
chosen them wisely, and they
freely shared their gifts and
insights amongst one another
to speed the process. The
Lord-Arcanums that led them
ensured that the Six Smiths
could work harder and faster
than ever, and that even those
would-be Stormcasts who
were brought to the edge of
destruction by their reforging
could be captured, brought
back to the complexes that
surrounded the Anvil of the
Apotheosis, and given new life.

As the vast majority of the
Stormhosts entered the fray,
their Sacrosanct Chambers
remained closed. As mystics
and lightning-sages, their war
was to protect the legions of
their brothers and ensure that
the flaw in the immortality of
their kind would not derail the
greater war effort. In doing so,
they would allow the Stormcast
Eternals to battle hosts many
times their own number.

Over the course of the
Realmgate Wars,
the complexes
in which the reforging took
place resounded to the clamour
of constant industry,
for
even Sigmar had not fully
appreciated the heights of
slaughter that would be reached
as war raged in every Mortal
Realm. Every hour of every day
new souls were remade upon
the Anvil of the Apotheosis.
The blades of Chaos bit deep
as the Stormhosts entered the
arenas of war again and again.

Soon enough the Sacrosanct
Chambers found themselves
hard-pressed, for the process
of reforging was volatile.
Those spirits so damaged by
war or eldritch weapons that
they could not be successfully
remade – along with those
that escaped from the soul
forges to crackle away into
the city outside – were usually
recovered, but not always.
Those that could not find
physical form were instead
bound into statues that lined
the Avenue of Saints. The few
that have walked that long,

circular promenade say they
can hear screams on the cusp
of hearing, as if each giant
monument is more prison than
haven. As yet none have voiced
such suspicions, for Sigmar
does not suffer the inquisitive
gladly, and as a god, cannot be
judged by mortal men.

For decades, the Sacrosanct
Chambers allayed the glitch
in eternity that some amongst
the Stormhosts had begun to
call a curse. At first, only a few
in each conclave showed signs
that their reforging had been
anything less than perfect,
and when approached on the
matter,
the Lord-Celestants
and Lord-Relictors bade their
brothers keep their suspicions
to themselves. The Stormhosts
concentrated on the foes
without, rather than the strife
within, promising each other
they would find the truth
when the hour was less dire.
Unfortunately for all living
things, a new doom grew in the
shadows that would reshape
not only their destiny, but that
of the entire cosmos.

As Sigmar waged his new
crusade, Nagash was at work
in the macabre landscapes
of Shyish. The Supreme
Necromancer was an ancient
nemesis of the God-King,
but upon entering the Mortal
Realms, the two were forced
into an alliance against their
common enemy – Chaos.
Since then, however, events
have led them into conflict
with each other once more.
As far as Nagash is concerned,
Sigmar steals from him with
every soul he reforges, and
this is something the Great
Necromancer wi l l not tolerate.

During the Age of Chaos,
Nagash appeared to play the
role of the spider in its web,
seemingly content to wait for
the souls of the dead to enter
the domains he had claimed
as his own, and displaying
no aspirations to conquer
the other Mortal Realms. For
Sigmar, ever focused on his
war upon the Dark Gods, this
was a status quo he was willing
to endure.

In truth, however, Nagash’s
ambitions were not so modest.
He expanded his domain into a
hundred different underworlds,
overthrowing or consuming
their lesser deities. His legions
of bone, dead flesh and spirit
grew so numerous that even
the lords of Chaos, who had
conquered so many of the lands
of the dead, were hard-pressed
to stop him – and whenever
Nagash matched his might
against that of the Dark Gods,
Sigmar stood to gain. However,
in the schemes of the Lord of
Undeath, these grand wars
were no more than feints. His
true purpose was to have even
greater ramifications.

THE SHYISH
NECROQUAKE

As with the other Mortal
Realms, the realmstone of
Shyish tended to gather in
greatest concentrations at
the edge. Over the centuries,

Nagash’s
forces laboured
ceaselessly to carr y the
granular realmstone of Shyish
to his lair at Nagashizzar. By
vitr ifying this grave-sand
under the intense heat of his
dark magic, Nagash raised up
glassy black monoliths and
tall pyramids. Sigmar and his
fellow gods of Order saw this
as a labour of vanity,
typical
of one so monomaniacal as
Nagash. But these structures
were designed for a darker
purpose. Only when portents
of doom and woe started to
echo through reality did the
God-King become aware of the
magnitude of Nagash’s plans.
Though he reacted swiftly,
it
was too late to stop the dark
ritual underway in Shyish.

By harnessing the Shyishan
realmstone in such measure,
Nagash succeeded in inverting
the magical polarity of the
realm. This grand act of cosmic
engineering caused magic to
be drawn to the heart of the
realm, rather than to its edge.
This slowly began to pull all the
underworlds of Shyish towards
Nagash’s
lair, their ultimate fate
to be ground down into purest
Shyishan magic. Worse still,
the explosive aftermath of that
great collapse caused a wave of
undeath to cascade across the
aether into the other realms.

The epoch-shattering
explosion that boomed out
from Shyish carried with it
the spirits of the dead. Each
soul was drawn along the

impossibly thin silver cord
that connected it to its mortal
remains, emerging as a twisted
Nighthaunt revenant from the
grave of its former resting site.
The necroquake had come,
and with the unleashing of
countless millions of ravening
gheists, the path for Nagash’s
ultimate conquest was laid
wide open. In one devastating
act, Nagash became a force
so powerful he had a claim to
every Mortal Realm, and the
forces of Order fell before the
hurricane of undeath just as
did the worshippers of the Dark
Gods and the savage tribes
of Gorkamorka.

However, Nagash’s
legions did
not go entirely unopposed.
For some time, Sigmar had
suspected that Nagash would
not be content to suffer the rise
of Order, and in secret he had
founded a countermeasure
against undead invasion – a
breed of warrior with enough
knowledge of the supernatural,
enough power over unquiet
spirits, and enough in the way
of numbers to stop Nagash
devastating all the God-
King had worked for. These
were the warrior-mystics of
the Sacrosanct Chambers.
Following the necroquake,
Sigmar’s arcane legions were
sent from the Heavens in
serried columns of lightning.
They proved critical in the days
to come, holding back the hosts
of Nighthaunts that cascaded
across the lands.

But Sigmar’s actions were not
without sacrifice. With the
Sacrosanct Chambers no longer
watching over the Anvil of the
Apotheosis, more Stormcasts
than ever returned from their
reforging bearing pronounced
scars from their experience. Yet
there was still hope. Though
few knew it, the Sacrosanct
Chambers had a secondary
agenda – to seek a solution
to the flaw in the reforging
process, even if it meant
delving into the most benighted
places to find it.


PAGEBREAK
As the Shyish necroquake shakes the Mortal Realms, the soul-forging palaces and citadels once
guarded by the Sacrosanct Chambers go untended – and this, too, brings its own form of disaster.


PAGEBREAK
Meet horror with bravery. Meet darkness with light. Meet the threat of doom with the vision of a golden future.
These lessons the Stormcast Eternals taught those of the free city of Glymmsforge, hoping the flame of defiance
would roar into a blaze. But the cold claw of Nagash was already closing upon the lands to snuff out that fire.

The Works of Sigmar Rise High

16

THE WORKS OF SIGMAR RISE HIGH

Stormkeeps are vast, heavily ornamented fortresses that not only defend Sigmar’s most vital
holdings, but send a powerful message of dominance to those who see them – no matter what came
before, they proclaim, this is now the sovereign domain of the God-King.

The fortresses of the Stormcast
Eternals are breathtaking in
their magnificence. In form
and structure no two are the
same; some have walls like
baroque cliffs lined with stoic
statuary and soaring pillars,
others glimmer from the
clouds, borne aloft on floating
mountains that are practically
unassailable. Some are even
built into vast cavern networks,
their labyrinthine tunnels lit by
lightning-sconces that crackle
to life when travellers pass by.

THE REALMGATE
HEART

All Stormkeeps are built
around Realmgates, for Sigmar
prizes these portals highly,
knowing that without them
his armies could make no
headway in the war against
his foes. Because of this, some
Stormkeeps are found in truly
inhospitable places, where there
are still Realmgates unsullied
by the energies of Chaos. Some
are built in the desert or upon
the open plain, with no source
of water or natural defence for
hundreds of miles around. Yet
the engineers and architects
loyal to Sigmar are as tenacious
as they are inventive, and
they know well that ultimate
victory is contingent upon
their success. Whether by
artifice, engineering or sheer
force of will, the challenges
presented by each Realmgate
are overcome.

The Stormkeep must then be
fortified with battlements to
stop besiegers that would see
such works cast down. Just as
importantly,
the Realmgate
itself must be reinforced with
arcane wards and heavy gates
to prevent invaders coming
through to attack the keep
from the inside.

As well as being used to
transport war materiel, and
giving passage to ever ything
from solo messengers to vast
armoured phalanxes, the
Realmgate portal at the heart
of each Stormkeep is a vital
source of trade. Places once
inimical to life can only be
made habitable with a steady
influx of food, water and
supplies. Realmgates are also
critical for ensuring the flow
of information. The Swifthawk
Agents,
in their role as the
messengers and emissaries of
the free cities, make frequent
use of these portals.

Anyone travelling through
a Realmgate risks their
life each time, for even a
stable Realmgate can be
unpredictable. Though these
portals have been studied
extensively,
their workings are
still barely understood. Those
who make their way through
them do so at their own risk,
but they go nonetheless, with
faith as their primary defence.

THE FIRST
STORMKEEPS

Early in the war for the
Realmgates, Sigmar had his
Stormcast Eternals strike
specific portal sites with sudden

and shocking force. The first
brotherhoods to attack formed
beachheads that were then
permanently manned by the
Stormhosts that had shed the
most blood to claim them. In
time, the leaders of the chosen
hosts were each given a stone
plaque known as a Celestine
Writ,
its words blasted into
being by Sigmar’s lightning.
Accepting this holy artefact is
an oath of sorts, for it grants
Sigmar leave to take that
Realmgate and its surroundings
as his own domain, on the
condition that it will never fall
whilst even one member of that
Stormhost is still alive.

The first days were the most
difficult. The element of
surprise was a key facet of
the Stormhosts’ early success,
but soon enough they found
themselves assailed time and
time again by the forces they
had formerly hurled back. The
Lord-Castellants oversaw these
sites, their defences reinforced
with shield walls of Liberators
and bolstered by lines of eagle-
eyed Judicators that together
formed a living fortification of
sigmarite and celestial power.
Where the forces of darkness
struck back, invigorated by
the prospect of war against a
new breed of foe, these small
nexuses of resistance fought
with every iota of their strength
to hurl back their attackers.
In almost all cases they were
successful, but hundreds
of thousands of Stormcast
Eternals were slain in the
process. Though it took days or
even weeks for reinforcements
to arrive in some places, these
standing armies were bolstered
by warrior hosts from Azyr –
and along with them came a
great many masons, artisans
and strong-limbed work teams
from Azyrheim.


PAGEBREAK
17

It was not only men that
laboured to lay the first
foundations of the Stormkeeps,
but throngs of Dispossessed
as well, and even small cliques
of aelves skilled in the arts of
creation. The duardin found
they were in their element,
hewing, quarr ying and
dressing stone as they put every
iota of their inventiveness
and skill to the business of
raising fortifications around
the defences of the newly
claimed Realmgates.

The humans toiled endlessly,
able to adapt with impressive
speed to the rigours of the
strange new habitats they
would come to call home.
The aelves aided the Lord-
Castellants and their Lord-
Relictor advisors in the magical
defences of each Stormkeep,
for they had to stand strong
against daemons and evil
spirits as well as enemies of
flesh and blood. Soon enough,
as worker-songs in the deep
bass of the duardin tongue
mingled with aelven creation
chants and the percussion of
human hammers, chisels and
mattocks, the first Stormkeeps
took shape.

STONE UPON STONE

Usually,
the first defences built
around a claimed Realmgate
are simple keeps and curtain
walls, but over time they
become increasingly elaborate.
The walls are reinforced with
towering buttresses and cannon
nests built along crenellated
ramparts to the exacting
specifications of the Ironweld
Arsenal. Moats are dug deep,
rivers rerouted, and reservoirs
and rain-gathering sluice
networks are established in
those lands too dr y to sustain a
swiftly growing population.

As each concentric ring of
fortifications is completed
around the original site,
another wi l l already be
underway. With the enemies
of Sigmar battering hard

at the gates of each nascent
city – being repelled by the
smallest of margins in many
places, and overcoming others
entirely – those within work
on the premise that there is no
such thing as having too many
defences. Higher and higher go
the fortifications, one level built
atop another. The original walls
– built strong and stout enough
to last for centuries – form the
foundations for ironoak joist
lattices and vault-supported
mosaic flooring.

The Lord-Celestants of the
Stormhosts commission vast
statues of the heroes that
liberated the Realmgate and
of those that have fought since
those first desperate days,
commemorating the sacrifice
made by these key figures.
Some statues are enchanted,
able to breathe lightning from
cold stone mouths or drop
enormous hammers should a
would-be besieger pass within
reach. In every Stormkeep, new
developments and innovations
grow,
their form dictated by
militar y function as much
as aesthetic style. Archery
batteries, spiral staircases,
star-fort walls, cloud-piercing
spires, gilded minarets, spy-
towers, overseer colonnades,
balustrades, boulevards and
promenades take shape.
And so the Stormkeeps grow
ever greater.

The limits of each Stormkeep’s
aegis are extended slowly but

steadily as the Azyrite hosts
bolster their defences. The
lands themselves, often tainted
by the energies of Chaos, are
cleansed by processions of
chanting Devoted. Long lateral
lines of Flagellants whip their
own backs as they march
out from each Stormkeep, so
that their blood – given in
faith – can purify the lands.
Those sites too corrupted to
be saved by this method are
attended to by the new city’s
battle mages or, failing that, the
elementalists of the Eldritch
Council. Eventually,
the
lands are tamed around each
settlement, and the boundaries
of the Stormkeep expanded.

As each fortress grows stronger,
ever more Stormcast Eternals
are despatched to take up
residence in its halls, temples
and meditation vaults. The
leaders of each host look to
the skies from scryer-arenas,
observatoriums and cells open
to the sky, reading the celestial
portents and even astrally
projecting their souls to divine
the optimum deployment of
troops and defences. Frescoes
and mosaics depicting the
liberation of the lands are lit
brightly by lightning globes, for
the realms have languished too
long in darkness, and tales of
their emancipation should be
spread far.

With the aid of their skilled
Dispossessed allies, Lord-
Castellants fit the Stormkeeps
with colossal orreries with
which to delve deeper into the
secrets of the stars. They cause
great fires of celestial flame to
burn eternally atop the highest
towers so that Sigmar might
see their fortresses standing
tall from High Azyr. These
celestial braziers, many of
which burn with twin tongues
of fire to mimic Sigmar’s
divine sigil, inspire hope in
the people of the cities below
– but they also remind them
that the God-King’s warriors
are always watching, stern
and uncompromising.


PAGEBREAK
18

Each established Stormkeep
has become a centre of learning
and study as well as a militar y
base. Archives of lore are
assembled painstaking ly from
scholarly collections imported
from Azyr, and combined with
soot-blackened tomes and
cartographical texts recovered
from the old cities burnt to
the ground by the forces of
Chaos. Gradually, new texts
are penned, vast teams of
scriptors and calligraphists
committing to parchment the
histories of the free cities. In
the most civilised regions,
the scribes and artists of the
new order have found ways
of replicating inspiring texts
and images via cog-wheeled
printing presses, intaglio,
etchings made with sulphur-
vitriol, or simply the fine art of
painstaking quillmanship.

So vast have these archives
become that the Stormcast
Eternals based in each keep
are able to continue the fight
against Chaos even when not
in the field, studying histories
and maps for local knowledge
that could help tip the balance
in the fight against the
dark powers.

Divine Connection

By working alongside
the Lord-Arcanums and
Knights-Incantor of their
Sacrosanct Chambers, the
Lord-Ordinators have created
vast crackling batteries of
celestial power that form a
metaphysical
link between a
Stormkeep and the underspires
of the Sigmarabulum. These
spirit links, known as Star
Bridges, speed the Stormcast
Eternals back to Azyr when

they are slain, ensuring swift
and safe passage so they might
be reforged all the quicker. A
Stormcast Eternal that dies
in battle near their keep wi l l
often return to active service
in a matter of days, possibly
taking up arms to rejoin the
same battle or siege that saw
them slain.

These cosmic links are
maintained by the same
celestial soul-force as that
produced when a Stormcast
Eternal discorporates. These
aetheric links can only be
sustained at fu l l strength by
the dissolution of souls – a
resource that the Sacrosanct
Chamber is well-placed to
provide, for they are experts at
capturing errant spirits. Some
Stormcast Eternals, who in the
course of war have committed
acts they believe to be beyond
redemption, willing ly
contribute their final energies
to power the Star Bridges. They
are blasted to nothingness,
their soul-stuff used to keep the
Star Bridge bright. In return,
their names are etched into the
Annals Tempestus that line the
walls of each Lord-Arcanum’s
sanctum, their sins forgiven.

LEGENDARY KEEPS

There are some amongst the
Stormkeeps that have already
become legendary amongst the
people of Sigmar’s realm. First
to be founded was Fort Ignis,
the Stormkeep nearest the site
of Vandus Hammerhand’s
victory over Korghos Khul
upon the Brimstone Peninsula.
Though that keep, surrounded
by a moat of ever-burning
flame,
is impressive indeed,
it was soon surpassed in size
and scale. As the hosts of
Azyr pressed onward to claim
new ground and found new
Stormkeeps, they learned

more of the realms they
sought to tame, and became
ever more ambitious in their
constructions. Amongst
the most well-known is the
Perspicarium, which watches
from a high pillar of rock over
the Stormrift Realmgate at the
heart of Hammerhal Aqsha. A
stronghold of the Hammers of
Sigmar,
this fortress dispatches
its armed hosts every day.

The Consecralium, fortress
of the Knights Excelsior,
is
terrifying to behold, its black
iron battlements crowned with
raging storms. Separated from
the city of Excelsis by a long
narrow bridge, the Stormkeep
looms like an executioner’s axe
above the skyline. Crossing
that bridge is a trial in itself,
and those who enter with even
a slight stain upon their honour
rarely come back out.

The Black Nexus, Stormkeep
of Anvilgard,
is a dark place
of ill aspect, but through the
ceaseless warmongering of its
warriors, the lands have been
scoured of evil for a hundred
miles around. The Celestrine
Cathedral in Hallowheart is
so redolent with the faith of
the Hallowed Knights that it
shines like a beacon to those
with the witchsight; word has
it that pilgrim souls who walk
through its inner gates are
purified by the act, even if it
burns away a part of their core
essence. Oakenspire, at the
heart of Ghyran’s Living City,
is
made of ironoak and fossilised
timber, and is crowned with
golden flowers, a riot of green
foliage, autumnal
leaves or
cruel black thorns

the season.

perhaps, that the Stormcast
Eternals have lately taken
such stringent measures in
controlling this unrest and
removing – sometimes by
lethal force – those that would

Stormkeeps glow with celestial
power, they too cast long
shadows. Those who dwell
in the cities around them

citadels in awe, fear, and
even bitterness – for those

on the fringe of greatness do

As more regions are claimed
by Sigmar’s faithful, more
Stormkeeps are built,
consolidating the God-King’s
hard-won holdings with each
brick and stone.

Not all Stormkeeps have
survived the endless onslaught
of Chaos, the savagery of the
bestial hordes and the coming
of the Shyish necroquake. The
valiant survivors of ill-fated
Celsorium were frozen to
death when the Everwinter of
a vast ogor tribe rolled over
the city, and the spiralling
Tower of Ravenstar was pulled

remain intact. Wherever

foes tunnel under the walls

A THOUSAND STORMS

A THOUSAND STORMS

Every land beset by Chaos has felt the thunder of the Stormcast Eternals’ charge. A thousand wars
and more they have brought to challenge the dominion of Chaos. Although but a fraction have
been recorded, the Stormhosts have achieved victories so profound they have become legend.

AGE OF MYTH

A NEW ERA DAWNS

Sigmar, having been shown
the splendours of the Mortal
Realms by the celestial
godbeast Dracothion, helps
unite the scattered tribes of
mankind and raise them from
savagery to master stone, metal
and fire. Though it takes many
centuries, the indigenous
tribes of the realms and those
sur viving cultures previously
lost in time are united. Under
Sigmar’s auspices they are given
the impetus to create wondrous
cities, and thriving nations
spring up by the hundred. The
Great Wonders of the Mortal
Realms are built at high cost
in blood, sweat, and even life,
for these edifices are legendary
in scale. Trade thrives through
the networks of Realmgates
that span the domains of the
disparate races.

DARKNESS CREEPS IN

As nations are established and
new powers thrive, the foibles,
lusts and jealousies of mortals
begin to sour cultures that
were once united in a common
goal. Those beings of emotion
and malevolence entwined, the
Chaos Gods, espy the Mortal
Realms and find themselves
half-mad with desire. Through
hairline cracks of opportunity
the gods of Chaos inveigle their
influence into the minds of
humans, duardin and orruks,
goading them to deeds that are
not wholly their own. Though
their baleful schemes are slow
to mature, the dark powers
begin to erode the fabric
of civilisation.

DAY OF THE DAEMON

In a hundred troubled regions
across the realms, the daemons
of Chaos find ways to break
into the Mortal Realms.

THE BATTLE OF
BURNING SKIES

The pall of Chaos falls across
one nation, then another,
toppling cities in a long-
planned conquest that spills
across the lands like blood
across a map. When the
daemonic scions of Chaos and
their sorcerous thra l ls bring
their supernatural powers to
bear against Sigmar’s chosen
people, the God-King takes
up his hammer and casts
them back wherever they are
to be found. Decades of war
sprawl on, with Chaos closing
its pernicious grip wherever
Sigmar’s back is turned.

Only at the Battle of Burning
Skies does the God-King realise
his folly – though he can claim
small victories through might
of arms, he can never alone win
the long war the Dark Gods are
waging in every realm at once.

After being tricked into losing
his hammer Ghal Maraz in a
duel with Archaon, the God-
King resolves to withdraw to
the Realm of Heavens, closing
the Gates of Azyr behind
him. There he broods long on
the fates of the people he left
behind, as the tyrants of Chaos
are free to consume the lands
he once protected.

AGE OF CHAOS

THE RED CENTURY

With Sigmar relinquishing his
rule over the Mortal Realms,
the nations and tribes that
once thrived there are ground
down and enslaved by the cruel
minions of Chaos. Daily life
becomes a hellish nightmare.

A NEW ARMY

Inspiration strikes as Sigmar
gazes in despair upon the
Mortal Realms. Using all his
artifice and the aid of Grungni,
the Great Maker,
the God-
King fashions a new army with
which to fight his eternal war.
The spirits of those mortals
who spit and rage in the face of
Chaos are seized and taken up
to Azyr,
there to be reforged as
Stormcast Eternals.

Sigmar’s great work is concealed
by the artifice of his aelven
allies, Malerion and Teclis,
their magic so well-woven that
even the sorcerous scryers of
Tzeentch cannot penetrate it.
Though the forces of Chaos
batter at the Gates of Azyr for
decades, hurling everything
they can at the ancient portals,
they cannot force entrance. In
time they stop trying, turning
their attention to the other
seven Mortal Realms instead.

THE LONG WAIT

The years tick past. The first
hosts of Sigmar’s warriors train
in his Gladitorium to be ready
for the new era of war. A gift
from Malerion, the enchanted
dome of the Gladitorium
enables the Stormcasts to
fight each other, yet arise
unharmed when battle is done.
In the greatest exercises, entire
Stormhosts are pitted against
each other in thunderous war
drills that make dust-storms of
the arena’s
sands.

THE CLEANSING OF AZYR

When Sigmar withdrew to
Azyr, he took a good many
refugees with him to the
safety of Azyrheim. Now he
sees that many of the rescued
tribes cannot set aside their old
rivalries, and in places this has
escalated to civil war. Worse
still, he sees that some are being
corrupted by Chaos. Along
with the refugees he welcomed
into the Realm of Heavens
came hundreds of covert
worshippers of the Dark Gods,
disguised amongst the free folk.
Their insidious influence has
already spread far through the
underbelly of society.

Incandescent with rage, Sigmar
descends in a blaze of light
from his godly palace. With
lightning crackling in a halo
around his brow, he brings
the wrath of the Heavens
down upon the sorcerers and
daemon-worshippers who seek
to taint his utopian city. Every
one of the Chaos agents is
slain in a single night, and any
citizens who cannot let go of
their old grudges against one
another are burned to cinders
by his gaze.

To ensure no such corruption
can recur in Azyrheim, Sigmar
trusts the witch-hunting
Order of Azyr with the task of
tracking down and executing
evil-doers wherever they are
to be found. He also sends
out the Shadowblades, aelven
Assassins that ki l l in secret.
Their duty is the eradication
of any who stray towards the
darkness. From this point on,
all of Azyr’s enclaves of orruks
and creatures tainted by Chaos
are hunted down, first by the
brave armies of Azyrheim,
and then by the newly
formed Stormhosts as part of
their training.

Peace rules in Sigmar’s city
once more. A new era of
progress begins in Azyrheim
– albeit a status quo enforced
by the fear of swift and
final retribution.

AGE OF SIGMAR

THE TEMPEST BREAKS

The powers of Chaos, after five
long centuries of dominance,
have claimed the vast majority
of the Mortal Realms for their
own. Though his great work
is not complete, Sigmar sends
forth his warriors amid a
clashing, roiling thunderhead
that breaks into every realm
at once. On columns of
lightning they are borne to
the battlefield, their assault so
sudden and powerful that the
forces of Chaos are hurled back
from the sites Sigmar considers
most vital.

New war rages across the
realms, with the God-King’s
living tempest never tiring.
With the Realmgates of
paramount importance to
his long-planned conquest,
Sigmar’s Stormhosts
concentrate their efforts on
reclaiming those sites and
fortifying them at all costs.
Upon Aqshy’s arid sprawl –
the Great Parch in particular
– the Hammers of Sigmar
lead the fight. The Stormhost
first strikes at the Brimstone
Peninsula, where Vandus
Hammerhand’s Thunderstrike
Brotherhood seizes the first
Gate of Azyr from the Goretide
of Korghos Khul. Many
victories are won against the
armies of Khorne, though the
Hammers pay a heavy price. It
is the beginning of a fierce and
deadly rivalry.

VENGEANCE LONG
AWAITED

During the Red Century,
four
almighty monoliths were raised
over the once-great city of
Thal’donn to commemorate
a key victory for the forces of
Chaos. Sigmar is determined
to bring down these symbolic
affronts. The Black Dracothians
and the Lions of Sigmar lead a
Stormhost coalition that levels
the monoliths and every Chaos
bastion and fort in the region.
It is said in Azyr that upon this
day, Sigmar smiled.

AZYRHEIM ’S HOSTS

With many Gates of Azyr
open, the paths into the
Mortal Realms are once more
accessible to the vengeful
armies of Azyrheim. Many
warhosts issue forth, fighting
on their own or aiding the
Stormcast Eternals to cast
down the tyrant and the
oppressor. Songs and stories
of valour are dedicated to the
memories of homes long lost
and families long slain, yet the
letting of blood can never truly
heal those ancestral wounds.

BESIEGING THE BLACK
RIFT OF KLAXUS

A vile ritual takes place in the
Sulphur Citadel, a vast fortress
that overlooks the kingdom
of K laxus. At the ritual’s
conclusion it rips open a dark
passageway into the Realm of
Chaos. To halt the outpouring
of daemon legions from that
weeping opening, Sigmar hurls
down scores of thunderbolts,
each bearing a phalanx of
Stormcast Eternals to war.
After days of battle, the Black
Rift is finally collapsed.

THE SOLEMN AND
THE DEAD

In Shyish’s
Innerlands the
Anvils of the Heldenhammer
fight through the living dead
– and sometimes alongside
them – to hurl back the greater
evil of Chaos. Each Stormhost
wins its own sagas and tales
of heroism as the wars unfold.
To the south of Nulahmia,
the Bloodbound warbands
of Knasvan Skullrender are
annihilated when they are
caught between the vast
skeletal horde of Neferata and
the unyielding shieldwall of the
Anvils of the Heldenhammer.
Hope is renewed for a lasting
alliance between the God-King
and the Lord of the Dead.

THE HELDENHAMMER
CRUSADE

In Chamon, Ghal Maraz is
recovered from the Eldritch
Fortress of Anvrok by the
combined efforts of Thostos
Bladestorm and Vandus
Hammerhand. Unable to
touch the sacred hammer,
Tzeentch’s minions had built
a stronghold around it to hide
its whereabouts, but during
a great battle against the
sorcerer Ephryx, its divine light
is uncovered.

In the Hanging Valleys of
Anvrok,
it is the Celestial
Vindicators that lead the
charge, their thirst for
vengeance unsated no matter
how many of the Slaves to
Darkness they slay. Fighting
through skaven ambushes, evil
sorcery, meddling daemons
and the Goretide, the combined
Stormhosts penetrate the
Eldritch Fortress even as it
begins to translocate into the
Realm of Chaos. Thanks to
betrayal amongst the Chaos
ranks and the wrath of Lord
Khul, Vandus Hammerhand of
the Hammers of Sigmar is able
to fight his way to the heart of
the fortress and at last recover
Ghal Maraz.

THE AWAKENING

A triumphal twelve-day feast
is held for the warriors that
played a part in returning
Ghal Maraz to Sigmar.
Upon receiving his almighty
warhammer,
the God-King
strides into the spell-shielded
Black Citadel. There, in the
Chamber Extremis, Sigmar
places Ghal Maraz into the
hands of the recumbent figure
within. With thunderstorms
raging and lightning wreathing
the Sigmarabulum, the
Celestant-Prime arises. With
this glorious figure leading
them, the Stormhosts win
many lasting victories.

THE BALANCE SHIFTS

In Ghyran, which has long
stood upon the threshold of
irrecoverable disaster,
the

Hallowed Knights join in
alliance with the forces of the
Sylvaneth to aid Alarielle the
Everqueen. Having fought
with ever ything in their
power to protect Alarielle’s
soulpod from Nurgle’s
foetid
hosts, Lord-Celestant Gardus,
Lord-Castellant Gr ymn, their
Hallowed Knights brethren
and the mar tyrs of many other
Stormhosts are vindicated
when Alarielle re-emerges
from dormancy in her war
form. Full of wrath, she leads
a merciless purge of her realm
to free it from Nurgle’s
taint
that culminates with the defeat
of the Plague God’s favoured
triplets, the Glottkin.

In the closing stages of this
war, the Nurgle warlord
Torglug the Despised is struck
by Ghal Maraz, and the part
of his soul that is still noble
hurtles to Azyr to be absolved
– and reforged as Tornus
the Redeemed.

Meanwhile,
in Chamon, the
Hammerhands seek to keep
the daemonic oracle Kiathanus
from Archaon’s
clutches. The
Everchosen’s might is too
great, and upon the flanks of
Mount Kronus they are slain
to a man. Their sacrifice does
not go unnoticed, however, and
Dracothion roars his defiance.

RISE OF THE GODBEASTS

Archaon’s
counter-attack is
fierce. He sets out to compel
the zodiacal godbeasts to fight
for his cause, knowing that
their might wi l l make him all

but unstoppable. In Aqshy, he
binds the Solar Drake Ignax,
though the enslavement
of Behemat, the Father of
Gargants,
is foiled at the last
by the Knights Excelsior and
the divine lightning ritual that
summons the Great Bolts.

ERA DRACONIS

The mighty energies unleashed
by Dracothion empower and
open the Extremis Chamber,
that famous union of Stormcast
Eternal and celestial beast.
Before long, Dracoth riders
and Stardrake-borne paladins
hurtle down from on high to
join the ongoing war. Their
first major test comes as the
siege of the Soulhaven Citadel
enters its third season. Dozens
of Varanguard take to the
field, tasked by Archaon with
the sacred site’s destruction.
As the dread knights charge,
stars rain from the sky, and
the Dracothian Guard of the
Hammerclaws burst out of
the meteor strikes to launch
a devastating counter-attack.
It is the first instance of an
onslaught that drives back the
most formidable warriors of
Chaos in all the realms – but
not the last.

THE NEXUS WARS

The final battle of the
Realmgate Wars is fought at
the All-gates. Determined to
stem the endless tide of Chaos
reinforcements flowing from
the eight macro-portals of the
Allpoints, Sigmar unleashes all
of his available Stormhosts in
an attempt to deny Archaon his
greatest asset in the conquest of
the realmspheres. After many
terrible battles, the Genesis
Gate and the Brimfire Gate are
wrested from the Everchosen’s
grasp. Though Chaos keeps its
throttling stranglehold upon
most of the Mortal Realms,
in Aqshy and Ghyran it is
weakened. The tales of valour
from this time pass into myth,
forming the basis of a thousand
legends depicted in triumphal
monuments in those lands
reclaimed from Chaos.

THE OPENING OF THE
SKY BRIDGES

The Skyrealm – one of the
twelve natural wonders of Ghur
– has long been corrupted by
Chaos. Instead of assailing the
fortress-laden main islands,
the Stormcast Eternals strike
at the aerial bridges that
connect that floating continent
to the lands around it. In the
end, the Sky Bridges are only
claimed after all the Stormhosts
sent to conquer it mass their
Prosecutors for a single aerial
strike. but the battle for the
islands themselves is far
from won.

THE SEEDS OF HOPE

In Ghyran, the new cities
known as the Seeds of Hope
are brought into being,
their growth accelerated by
Alarielle’s boundless life magic.
Though each city is markedly
different to its counterparts,
they all prove to be stoic
enclaves of civilisation in a land
once all-but destroyed by the
vile attention of Nurgle. Word
of these first cities spreads
across the realms, and they
become symbols of what the
forces of Order can achieve
even in the heartlands of the
Dark Gods’ conquest.

A TRIUMPHAL SILENCE

For the longest period since its
creation, the mournful tolling
of the Bell of Lamentations is
stilled. The great tocsin rings
for every new act of atrocity
committed by the scions of the
Dark Gods, and has not been
quiet since the height of the
Age of Chaos. Its total silence
– though lasting only a few
blissful hours – acts as a new
kind of tribute to the fallen,
signalling the first return
of justice and Order to the
Mortal Realms.

THE EBON CIRCLE

Lord-Relictor Tharnus
Shrinesong hand-picks a
force from the Lightning
Hawks Stormhost that have
been gravely scarred by their
many reforgings. Dubbing his

unorthodox brotherhood the
Ebon Circle, Tharnus daubs
their argent battle plate with
pitch and leads them deep into
the Silver Tower of a Gaunt
Summoner. Each grim warrior
proves anathema to sorceries
that might have shattered more
coherent minds, as Shrinesong
had hoped would be the case.
Together they banish countless
foes with hammer and blade,
though they never locate the
tower’s master. Upon their
eventual escape from the Silver
Tower they take the fight to
Chaos in a dozen different
theatres of war, but never seek
to rejoin their Stormhost, for
Shrinesong feels the reunion
wi l l not be a happy one.

THE SHATTERED SIEGE

When the siege towers of
Dagramm Thule approach
the Baeyrd lodge in Aqshy,
twenty retinues of Decimators
from the Sons of Mallus strike
down into the Chaos horde’s
midst. Led by Lord-Castellant
Selithon Blackstar,
they cleave
their way towards the towering
constructs before hacking the
legs from the twisted gargants
that push them. In doing so,
they save the magmahold and
forge an unbreakable bond
between their Stormhost and
the Fyreslayers lodge.

RUNNING WITH
THE PACK

Raised by a pack of Gryph-
hounds in the lowlands of the
Boralis Mountains, Arden
Gr yphkin becomes the first
mortal to be reforged and
inducted into the Vanguard
Auxi liar y Chambers without
having previously served
in the Strike Chambers.
His Vanguard-Hunters,
the
Goldtalons, become famous
for launching ferocious
ambushes with the aid of their
four-legged companions.

PURITY WITHOUT
COMPROMISE

After destroying a Tzeentchian
cult that had infiltrated the
silver city of Alshime, Lord-

Veritant Mathius declares
his work unfinished and the
corruption not yet weeded
out. He leads a Hammerstrike
Force of the Knights Excelsior
in a bloody purge of the city’s
Freeguild and Collegiate
Arcane leaders, lest the taint of
Chaos lingers among them.

LAITHIREL CLEANSED

Beleaguered by the dreadful
war constructs of the Clans
Skr yre, Sylvaneth of the
Harvestboon clans welcome
the timely arrival of the
Radiant Suns of Sigmar, whose
Dracothian Guard descend
upon the Vale of Laithirel
in
a gleaming phalanx. Wily
even in defence, the skaven
Arch-warlock Gleed signals an
enfilade from a line of Warp
Lightning Cannons he thought
hidden – but even as he does so,
the massive shadow of Lord-
Celestant Orias’ Stardrake
engulfs the skaven ar ti l ler y
crews from on high. Their end
is swift.

VISIONS OF UNDEATH

It is Vandus Hammerhand,
Lord-Celestant of the
Hammers of Sigmar, who
first witnesses visions of
malign manifestations and
deathly conjurations spilling
across the Mortal Realms. He
foresees that in their wake wi l l
come superstition and strife,
and after that, the hideous
phenomenon of undeath. In
Vandus’
troubled mind, the
figure of pure celestial energy
he comes to think of as the
Lightning Man visits him in
the dark of night, drawing
closer each time until his
whispers become an audible
warning. He imparts a dread
truth – that Nagash seeks to
harness all the magical energies
of Shyish, and thereby change
it from the natural destination
of every departed soul into
a domain of Undeath, where
every single entity is bound
in thra l l to Nagash’s bidding.
Vandus brings this message to
Lord Sigmar, and the God-
King’s great brow furrows deep.


PAGEBREAK
24

DESCENT OF METEORS

Sigmar resists the urge to go
burning with indignation into
Shyish to hunt Nagash and
bring him down in person,
for he has learned much
from the Realmgate Wars.
Instead he gives the people
of the realms the means to
save themselves. He climbs
the spiralling ascent to the
High Star Sigendil and, with
a sweep of his hand, catches
meteors rich in the prophetic
realmstone celestium. These he
hurls into the Mortal Realms,
each magical monolith burning
like a twin-tailed comet as it
plummets to earth.

The celestium meteors dig
deep into the soil of the
Mortal Realms, where they
bring prophecies and visions
of salvation to magisters and
simple folk alike. Sigmar
sends out emissaries from his
Sacrosanct Chambers – his
Lord-Ordinators, masters
of scr ying and leaders of
men – to find where the
meteors have come to land.
Sequestering them from
would-be soothsayers seeking
to mine them for celestium, the
Lord-Ordinators use them to
divine possible futures. They
read the fates of each land and
prepare accordingly for what is
to come, marshalling armies to
march upon Nagash’s holdings
– their intent to disrupt and
even thwart his grand plans
before they come to fruition.

THE HARBINGERS
MARCH OUT

Sigmar is not alone in his
desire to halt the doom of
Shyish. Many of his rival gods
have become aware of the
dangers, and send their own
emissaries into Shyish at the
heads of massive armies. By the
time Sigmar’s Lord-Ordinators
pass into Shyish to march upon
Nagashizzar, harbingers of the
Dark Gods are already there –
and Nagash, having learned of
the intrusion into his domain,
sends his fell agents to stop
these intruders.

When the forces of Order
and Chaos converge upon
Nagashizzar, a tragic irony
unfolds. If either one had
successfully laid siege to the
Supreme Necromancer’s
fortress, perhaps his works
could have been stymied,
or even torn down. But the
Stormcast Eternals were
created specifically to fight
Chaos. The hosts from Azyr
have nothing but hatred in
their hearts for those that long
ago slaughtered their kin, and
the forging of an alliance is out
of the question.

As Sigmar’s faithful and their
Chaos-worshipping adversaries
give in to their bone-deep
enmity and fight in the
shadow of Nagash’s
citadel, the
Supreme Necromancer’s great
ritual has time enough to reach
a conclusion. Only a small
party of skaven make it to his
inner sanctums, and though
they disrupt the ritual, they do
not halt it.

THE SHYISH
NECROQUAKE

With the Great Black Pyramid
completed and Nagash’s
ritual
put in motion, a cataclysmic,
epoch-shattering implosion
of magic causes the heart
of Shyish to collapse like
that of a dying star. The
pyramid burrows down into
realmsphere until it pulls the
fabric of Shyish into a vast
funnel-like maelstrom with
Nagashizzar at the bottom. The
Shyish Nadir is born, a cursed

sinkhole in reality to which
all the deathly magic of the
cosmos is drawn.

IDONETH ALLIANCE

The majority of the Idoneth
Deepkin remain isolationists
as the Age of Sigmar rises –
only the Ionrach and their
direct offshoots make any
real effort to form alliances
in the name of holding back
Chaos. Conversely,
the new
cities prove too tempting a
target for the Fuethán, and that
enclave launches a series of
raids to claim the souls of their
inhabitants from conurbations
and trade routes across a dozen
coastal regions.

GREEN TIDE RISING

Tempest’s Eye is besieged from
below when an infestation of
Spiderfang Grots finds the
hidden cr ystal paths that lead
through the mountain’s heart.
The city’s garrison is forced to
abandon large portions of the
lower levels. Bolstered by their
Kharadron Overlord allies,
every one of the city’s masons
and engineers take to the
tunnels in order to shore up the
routes by which the grots are
entering the city.

THE BATTLE OF
GLYMMSFORGE

The necroquake sweeps across
Shyish, consuming lands
held by the forces of Order
and Chaos alike without
discrimination. A Sacrosanct
Chamber of the Hammers of
Sigmar is tested sorely when
two of its foremost arcanists
are sent to defend the city of
their birth, Glymmsforge,
from the forces of the traitor
knight Malendrek. They keep
the city from being completely
overwhelmed by Nighthaunt
hosts, but are forced to watch
helplessly as much of the land
around is swamped by the
energies of undeath.

THE LORD NIHILAT

Lord Andrus Nihilat of the
Hammers of Sigmar, reforged
thirteen times over the course


PAGEBREAK
25

of the Realmgate Wars,
slaughters a large part of the
Skullfiend Tribe just as they are
set to overwhelm a pilgrimage
to Hammerhal. He leads the
rescued pilgrims across the
Reaver Wastes in a punishing,
ceaseless march. Refusing to
modify his Stormhost’s pace, he
ignores the refugees’ entreaties
to slow. Only a third of the
rescued pilgrimage reaches
Hammerhal, the rest having
died from exposure, hunger
or the attacks of jackal-like
scavengers that harried their
column from behind.

THE PURGE OF
VINDICARUM

In the caldera-city of
Vindicarum, events come
to a head when the Celestial
Vindicators execute several
citizens on the spot as
punishment for thievery – for
to them, acts of crime and
rebellion are but the first step
on the road to open Chaos
worship. This summar y
judgement sends ripples
through the city, and soon
civic unrest turns to rioting
and disorder. The sparks of
conflict turn to an inferno
as the Celestial Vindicators
answer with limitless force,
bringing a terrible retribution
that sees three quarters of the
city slain in a single night.
The survivors seek solace and
safety by joining the ranks of
the Devoted, with more than
a few driven mad by their
experiences. Word of the purge
spreads through the free cities,
causing many to question the
true relationship between the
Stormcast Eternals and those
they are said to protect.

DESPERATE MEASURES

Several of the most beleaguered
Sacrosanct Chambers, knowing
the hour of their duty is upon
them, resort to increasingly
devastating sorceries to hold
back the armies of Nagash and
the daemon hosts that spill
from Chaos territories. They
unleash magical maelstroms
and searing tornadoes that

have a life of their own,
tapping into the endless magic
unleashed by the Shyish
necroquake. Some of these
sorceries escape the control of
their casters, ravaging the lands
around and even taking a toll
on those who stray from the
nearby townships. It becomes
common practice for city
elders and aldermen to employ
spell-hunters whose duty it is
to locate and dispel these rogue
manifestations – but they rarely
return from such missions.

THE SPIRE OF THE LOST

A new tower is raised near
the Bell of Lamentation in
Sigmaron. Known as the Spire
of the Lost, this corkscrewing
obelisk is engraved with the fu l l
names of all those Stormcast
Eternals that have met their
final death in service to the
God-King. At the top are Jactos
Goldenmane, slain by the axe
of Korghos Khul, and Thostos
Bladestorm, devoured by
Dorghar, Archaon’s daemonic
steed. Hundreds of other
names have been engraved
beneath them.

THE RESURRECTION
CRUSADE

In the campaign known as the
Resurrection Crusade, Sigmar
charges his Lord-Arcanums
with the task of reclaiming
the Shyishan territories
lost to the necroquake. The
Sacrosanct Chambers of fifty-
five Stormhosts are despatched
to the Shyish Innerlands,
each hoping to find a way to
hurl back the tide of undeath.
Furthermore, they seek to fulfil

their secret agenda: to find a
way to reverse the reforging
flaw that assails their kindred.

THE REDEEMED

As the Celestant-Prime
continues to lead Sigmar’s
crusade, he encounters more
and more souls he believes can
be turned from Chaos with the
power of Ghal Maraz. Tornus
the Redeemed is joined by more
of his kind, each one soul-
struck by Sigmar’s hammer and
sent to Azyr to be remade as a
worthy warrior.

Those who have been granted
this salvation receive few
accolades, however,
for their
brothers look askance at them
no matter how many times they
prove themselves. Recognising
the problem, Tornus rallies a
small army of the Redeemed
from a number of Stormhosts
and leads them in a series of
raids upon Nagash’s holdings.
Lord-Castellant Gr ymn
formally petitions for the
brotherhood to be disbanded,
concerned that they may turn
one another rogue as their old
ways rise to the surface. He is
overruled by the judgement of
the Celestant-Prime himself.

THE GOD-KING’S BRAND

Though warded against the
predations of Chaos, Azyr
is not so protected from the
malevolent hauntings that
now plague the realms. In the
city of Azyrheim, it is ruled a
crime to shirk from the fight
against the rising undead. Acts
of cowardice and treachery
are severely punished, and
such wayward individuals
are rounded up by the Lord-
Veritants of the Stormhosts
and the Order of Azyr to be
judged. Their flesh is given the
God-King’s Brand, a symbol so
redolent with sacred celestial
energies that it drives out
any evil thought and ensures
they remain loyal to Sigmar’s
throne. With its citizenry
rendered utterly devoted,
Azyrheim becomes stable
once more.

THE STORMHOSTS

26

THE STORMHOSTS

A militar y body of consummate order and discipline, a Stormhost is a well-oiled machine suited
for every theatre of war. With each chamber honed to carr y out interlocking strategies in concert
with its fellows, a Stormhost can overcome an enemy that outnumbers it a dozen times over.

Stormcast Eternals are
organised into numerous
Stormhosts, each of which has
a unique name and heraldry.
Numbering between five and
ten thousand warriors, each
is a mighty army in its own
right. Most Stormhosts are
subdivided into independent
battle groups – known as
chambers – which in turn are
divided into conclaves that
each consist of squad-level
retinues. These obey a clearly
defined hierarchy, but are still
flexible, allowing for a wide
range of forces specialising in
all manner of tactical warfare.

The exact number of
Stormhosts is a mystery to all
but the God-King himself,
for the Sigmarabulum – that
wondrous ring of palaces and
citadels that floats high above
Azyr – has been shrouded in a
veil of secrecy for hundreds of
years. The Stormhosts’ effect
upon the Mortal Realms is
the subject of many triumphal
songs and fables, but also
cautionary tales, sinister
parables and stories of bloody
retribution. It is not for the
Stormhosts to explain the
nature of their legions to
mortal men – only to act, and
in doing so, win victory.

Each Stormhost is led by a
Lord-Commander, a supreme
leader through whom Sigmar’s
will is realised. Supporting this
figure is a Command Echelon,
which is comprised of graduates
of the temples dedicated to the
disciplines of the officer cadre. It
is within these temples that the
Lord-Celestants, Lord-Relictors
and other lords and knights
of the Stormhost are trained
and equipped before they are
assigned to specific chambers.
At the time of the Realmgate

Wars, Sigmar’s Eighth Law
demanded that, upon death,
reforged lords and knights had
to pass through the appropriate
temple and prove their mastery
of its arts once more before they
were permitted to return to
their chamber. Similarly,
lower
ranking warriors had to pass
once more through the trials
of their respective conclave
before they could resume their
duties after being reforged.
Since then, the furious pace of
war, death and reincarnation
has proven so demanding that
this law has been repealed
entirely. All too often the
reforged are sent straight back
into the fight without time to
retrain, learn more of the foe,
or orient themselves after the
trauma of their violent death.
Each Stormcast does their
duty nonetheless; such is the
desperation of the hour that
the Stormhosts must trust
the steel within as well as the
sigmarite without.

CHAMBERS AND
CONCLAVES

A Stormhost is organised into
several chambers. Different
chambers maintain different
fighting strengths. An elite
Extremis Chamber might
number as few as thir ty
warriors – albeit riding
giant scaled beasts from the
stars – whereas, in contrast,
Strike Chambers are semi-
autonomous regiments that
usually number around three

hundred. At fu l l strength,
a Strike Chamber’s Lord-
Celestant may have as many
as five hundred Stormcast
Eternals at his command. As
war beckons across all of the
Mortal Realms, Stormhosts
are required to be deployed
in many different places
simultaneously, and hence
these individual groupings
must be ready to act together
as part of a large force, or on
their own.

The composition of these forces
is dependent upon the scale
of the task at hand. An entire
Stormhost or more might be
required to lay low a vast enemy
stronghold. More frequently,
however,
its chambers are sent
into separate theatres of war.
These too can be divided into
smaller fighting formations
to carr y out specific missions.
It is not uncommon to see a
conclave acting independently ;
such divisions are highly
specialised and can be deployed
to achieve specific tasks or take
on a certain type of foe. Also
common are brotherhoods –
formations hand-picked from
across the Stormhost to create a
more varied force.

When a Stormcast Eternal
emerges from the forge they
are assigned to a conclave
that trains and equips them.
Each conclave is dedicated to
a specific role, and is further
divided into specialist retinues.
For example,
in a Warrior
Chamber,
the Redeemer
Conclave comprises the main
battle-line troops, whereas the
Justicar Conclave supplies the
supporting missile troops. The
Angelos Conclave houses the
most mobile units, and the
Paladin Conclave acts as the
elite reserve.

The orders of these highly-ranked individuals
are communicated to the retinues by the
unit leaders known as primes. A retinue of
Liberators is united under a Liberator-Prime,
for instance, who gives the instructions of the
chamber command to their fellows. A prime
is usually marked out with embellishments
on their armour, such as a coloured plume
and elaborate helm or pauldron. They wi l l
sometimes carr y a particularly powerful
weapon or artefact in battle.

Other chambers have bespoke chamber
commands that complement their role. A
Vanguard Chamber wi l l be led by a Lord-
Aquilor, supported by a small group of
knights, so that its autonomous and fluid
structure can remain focused no matter
how far-flung its constituent elements. An
Extremis Chamber is led by a Lord-Celestant
mounted upon a mighty star-beast, along
with three Drakesworn Templars that lead
the Dracothian Guard to war. The Sacrosanct
Chamber has a far more esoteric command
structure, as befits those whose expertise is
more of the soul than the body.

CHAMBER COMMAND

Each chamber is presided over by the chamber
command, an assemblage of lords and knights
that have proved themselves exceptional
leaders in the Gladitorium – and in their
mortal lives before that.

The heroes at the head of each Strike Chamber
often form a council known as the Lords
of the Storm. The group is led by a Lord-
Celestant, a gifted warrior and strategist
who typically has around three hundred
Stormcast Eternals under his command. Each
Lord-Celestant answers to their Stormhost’s
Lord-Commander and Command Echelon,
who in turn answer to the Celestant-Prime
– and, ultimately,
to Sigmar himself. They
are supported by a Lord-Relictor, a priest of
Sigmar able to call upon the blessings of the
tempest. Though Strike Chambers may deviate
in the precise makeup of their command, they
typically include Lord-Castellants, masters
of defensive warfare; Knights-Vexillor, who
hold the standards of the Stormcast high; and
Knights-Heraldor, whose stentorian tones and
sonorous war-horns announce the coming of
the chamber that marches in their wake.

Other officers, such as the messenger Knights-
Azyros and the seekers of evil known as Lord-
Veritants, are given leave to pursue their arts
on quests that take them far from the main
body of their kin. In times of need, however,
they wi l l fight as part of a cogent whole.

CONCLAVE ICONOGRAPHY

Each of the conclaves within a Stormhost chamber has a distinctive icon that is emblazoned
on the pauldrons of its constituent warriors.

Angelos Conclaves scout ahead
of their brethren, using their
superior mobility to harass the
enemy and thin their ranks in
preparation for an assault.

Paladin Conclaves can be found
wherever the fighting is thickest.
They are the strongest of their
kind, the bane of terrors and the
doom of evil kings.

Redeemer Conclaves are the
sigmarite soul of the chamber
– stalwart, unflinching and
relentless. They are the core of the
Stormhost battle-line.

Justicar Conclaves seek out the
enemy’s weak points and punish
them from afar with storm-
forged weapons. They are ranged
combat specialists.

Corpuscant Conclaves are
comprised of those who can
channel
lightning through their
bodies at will, usually magical
adepts with great martial ski l l.

Ordinatos Conclaves specialise
in the machineries of war – from
portable ar ti l ler y pieces to siege
weapons and lightning-charged
battle engines.

STRIKE CHAMBERS

Strike Chambers make up
the majority of a Stormhost’s
fighting strength. There
are three types of Strike
Chamber : Warrior, Harbinger
and Exemplar. The exact
number of these chambers
varies from Stormhost to
Stormhost, but the Warrior
Chambers are usually the most
predominant,
for they are able
to adapt to almost any militar y
circumstance. The rank-and-
file are organised into fighting
units called retinues, each
consisting of between three and
twenty warriors led by a prime.

Warrior Chambers have up to
twenty-one retinues in four
conclaves – Angelos, Paladin,
Redeemer and Justicar. This
variety of troops affords the
Lord-Celestant a great degree
of choice when assigning
retinues to missions, and
tactical flexibility on the
battlefield. If the Redeemer
Conclave is the anvil, the
Paladin Conclave is the
hammer, whilst the Angelos
and Justicar Conclaves offer
their support in the vanguard
and the rear respectively.

Harbinger Chambers hold
up to fifteen retinues in three
conclaves. The core of a
Harbinger Chamber is a large
Angelos Conclave, which is
supported by smaller Redeemer
and Justicar Conclaves.
These chambers are focused
on the key speciality of the
Prosecutor retinues – they
are fast, manoeuvrable and
strike quickly to seize the
initiative from the enemy.
The Liberator and Judicator
retinues provide a solid base
for the flying troops to operate
from, and wi l l intervene
to prevent the Prosecutors
becoming embroiled in an
attritional melee.

Exemplar Chambers also
have up to fifteen retinues,
structured around a large
Paladin Conclave with
ancillar y Angelos and Justicar

Conclaves offering support.
Elite Paladin retinues are a
formidable force in any case,
but concentrated en masse
they are nigh unstoppable.
Exemplar Chambers are
among a Stormhost’s
strongest
weapons, and to them fall
the most demanding of
missions – demonstrated by
the number of reforgings these
stalwarts undergo.

It is true of all of the Strike
Chambers that, under the
astute leadership of the
chamber command, the
different conclaves can
combine their might and
best enemies many times
their size. Thus is forged a
war machine truly worthy of
Sigmar’s blessing.

TEMPEST CHAMBERS

Next to the Strike Chambers,
each Stormhost can call on
the Tempest Chambers, which
contain many of the more
wondrous and outlandish
warriors of the Stormhosts.
Tempest Chambers are varied
in function and organisation,
but ultimately serve as support
to the Strike Chambers. The
three known types are the
elite Extremis Chamber,
the
Vanguard Chamber – an
independent part of the wider
Auxi liar y Chambers – and the
Sacrosanct Chamber. Several
other Tempest Chambers are
named on the Stormhosts’
rolls and dedications, but
so far their organisation
and intended function are
unknown. Amongst them
are the Ruination Chamber,
the Covenant Chamber, and
the Logister Chamber. These
are collectively known as the
Unopened Chambers, and
for now, only Sigmar knows
their fate.

The majority of Stormhosts
can field but a single Extremis
Chamber – for their celestial
steeds are rare – but notably
the Hammers of Sigmar boast
several fu l l complements of this
formation. Extremis Chambers

are unusual
in that they
number as many noble beasts
as they do warriors; every
member of this organisation
has a bond with one of the
children of Dracothion,
and united they are all
but unstoppable.

Vanguard Chambers include
only the brightest and most
self-sufficient of the Stormcast
Eternals, and their Rangers
are entrusted with more
autonomy than the warriors
of any other chamber. Their
leadership is a looser structure
designed for oversight more
than direct command; each
Ranger is trusted to know their
battle-craft well, and to make
the right decision no matter
the trials ranged against them.
Many of their number are
loners or reclusive agents who
once fought Chaos on their
own, and as a result they can
seem aloof to those who do not
know their methods. While in
theory a Stormhost could have
dozens of Vanguard Chambers,
the number of Auxi liar y
Chambers available to a
Lord-Commander is restricted
to ensure they are used as
outriders, a role in which they
can truly excel, rather than
battle-line troops.

Each Stormhost has at least
one Sacrosanct Chamber.
Until the coming of the Shyish
necroquake, these arcane
institutions were swathed in
secrecy. Only now is their
nature becoming clear,
though
their agenda remains a closely
guarded secret.

‘We do not

talk of

the Eighth Law,

brother. Not since the All-points.

Just

trust

to the work of Sigmar

and the Six Smiths, and everything

will be fine.

I am sure of

it, as sure

as steel and fire. Now ready your

hammers. We have work to do.’

Castellant of Hallowhear t

Masters of the Celestial

MASTERS OF THE CELESTIAL

There is one chamber alone that governs matters of magic and arcane strength. Its warriors wield
storm energy, whether through their weapons or in its purest form. More than that, they keep vigil
over the process of reforging itself – without them, the Stormhosts have no eternal future at al l.

The Sacrosanct Chambers of
the Stormcast Eternals are
more attuned to the magic of
the storm than any other. It is
they who wield the raw power
of the Heavens in Sigmar’s
name, hurling thunderbolts,
summoning meteors and
wielding weapons so redolent
with aetheric power they
can send a spirit or daemon
screaming into nothingness.
Supported by highly
destructive ar ti l ler y weapons
imbued with the power of the
storm, the warrior-mystics of
the Sacrosanct Chambers are
capable of obliterating almost
any foe that crosses their path
with their potent magic.

The Sacrosanct Chambers
may not only hold the key to
defeating Sigmar’s direst foes,
but to the salvation of those
he sends to fight in his name.
One of the most critical stages
of a Stormcast’s
reforging is
his transformation upon the
Anvil of the Apotheosis. In a
great pillared hall, upon the
ensorcelled altar at its heart,
the energy that forms him is
wrought with the stuff of the
stars themselves. It is focused
into a new form through
the magic of the Six Smiths,
legendary beings descended
from the duardin god Grungni
the Maker. Throughout the
process, the essence of the

Stormcast is controlled and
shepherded by the skills of
the tempest mages of the
Sacrosanct Chambers. These
warrior sages are critical to the
reforging process, for they are
the guardians of souls.

To be remade upon the Anvil
of the Apotheosis is a traumatic
experience fraught with danger.
It can lead to the demise of the
soul, or perhaps worse still, can
result in the Stormcast’s
spirit
tearing free and becoming a
lightning gheist. Destructive
in its confusion and pain,
the crackling blur of animus
can cause carnage across the
Sigmarabulum and beyond.

THE IMPERFECTIONS BENEATH

Even when a Stormcast Eternal dies, his war is far from
over. In High Azyr he is reforged once more for service and,
depending on his achievements, perhaps even given a new
role in his Stormhost.

Yet as the Stormcasts live and die in this eternal cycle of war,
the hazards of reforging become ever more pronounced.
Firstly, a Stormcast Eternal does not always discorporate
upon death. Should he be slain by a sufficiently eldritch
spell or weapon, his innate connection with Azyr may be
disrupted. This can mean that he is truly lost, his spirit never
returning to the Heavens and his weapons and armour lying
scattered upon the field for scavengers and trophy-hunters
to claim. Whole wars have been fought to reclaim such
artefacts, but some still remain in the clutches of evil men and
ravening beasts.

Secondly, when a Stormcast Eternal
is reforged, he undergoes
a process so profound that when his discorporated form is
put back together by celestial magic he may lose something
of himself. This can be a treasured memory, a true name,
the identity of a loved one from his mortal life, or some
indefinable fragment of that which made him a human soul
in the first place. The Stormhosts have experienced various
phenomena haunting their ranks as their warriors are
reforged time and time again – the Knights of the Aurora
trail
light in their wake when they charge into battle, for
example, whereas the transfigured of the Knights Excelsior
leave smoking footprints wherever they walk. To some, such
changes make these storm warriors seem as monstrous as the
cursed foes they were made to fight.

It is the duty of the Sacrosanct
Chambers to recover – or
neutralise through magic
– such errant souls. It is a
testament to their skill that
many of these souls make it
back to the Anvil to complete
the reforging process, though
not all are salvageable. The
Sacrosanct Chambers are
rightfully feared as well as held
in awe, for should Sigmar deem
it necessary, they would ki l l
a rogue Stormcast Eternal
in
a heartbeat.

Much like the other echelons
of Sigmar’s gleaming hosts,
the Sacrosanct Chambers have
many different conclaves and
retinues within their order. All
of their members were once
wizards, sorcerers or beings
of magical talent, for they are
recruited exclusively from
souls that had some aptitude
for spellcasting in their former
lives. Some are from exotic
kingdoms indeed, and have
such skill with the arcane they
rival even the aelven elders
of Azyr. The Lord-Arcanum
of the Grave Brethren – the
foremost Anvils of the
Heldenhammer Sacrosanct

Chamber – hails from another
era entirely. Though his history
is shrouded, his ability to wield
the transmutative magic of
Chamon is such that he turned
the gold stores of the rebel city
Agnostai to granite with a wave
of his hand.

The Lord-Arcanums that
answer to each Stormhost’s
Lord-Commander are powerful
mages in their own right, as
are the Knights-Incantor that
act as their lieutenants in the
field. The ki l ling energies of the
storm are theirs to command;
they can loose the fur y of the
tempest in a dozen different
ways, summoning hurricanes
of devastation and gales of
aetheric force.

The rank-and-file warriors
that fight under them do not
manifest magic outwardly,
instead channelling their
mystical power into their own
bodies and sigmarite weaponry.
This makes them extremely
dangerous warriors, for their
innate potency is increased all
the more by the lightning of
Azyr crackling around their
hammers, staves and shields.

Those they smite are not only
cut apart or broken by the blow,
but also scorched and blasted
by celestial energy.

As the Sacrosanct Chambers’
warriors enter the war for
reality that has been long
raging across the realms, they
bring the ferocity of the storm
to all of Sigmar’s foes. The
God-King has long marshalled
their strength in secret, but
now is the time for them to
come forth. As experts in the
manipulation of spirit energy,
they make for the perfect
weapon against the ethereal
hosts of Shyish, whose numbers
are ever on the rise.

Nagash is seen as a betrayer in
Sigmar’s court, and the God-
King anticipated that the Great
Necromancer would expand
his power via magical means
sooner rather than later. When
the Shyish necroquake broke
across the realms, the doors of
the Sacrosanct Chambers were
flung wide in response, and
many of their warriors cast into
the realms to hold back the tide
of wraiths that threatened to
consume Sigmar’s new cities.

T heodric climbed the great spiral stairs
that led to the Shimmergate at a
steady pace, his brotherhood behind
him. Under his battered sigmarite, his bones
felt like they were made of splintered oak.
Though the chest wound that had killed his
last incarnation was only a memory, he
could still feel the bite of the Chaos lord’s axe
in his lungs whenever he breathed deep. He
would soon face such foes again. To his relief,
he still felt no trepidation at the prospect.
Yet in the mirrored pools at the base of the
Shimmergate, he had seen his own reflection.
It had not been as he remembered it, and that
had unsettled him deeply.
His Lord-Ordinator, Waldyr,
seemed to
pick up on his mood. ‘We have the streng th to
carry the day, Theo,’
said the big man quietly.
‘Perhaps more than ever.’
Theodric nodded, steeling himself as he
placed his masked helm over a face lined with
the cares of a hundred nations. He found his
calm, and stepped through the Realmgate.
There was a moment of disorientation, a

black-and-white cosmos blending together
in a thousand different ways. It coalesced to
become a v ista of a battle all but lost.
Around the gate’s exit was a shattered
palisade wall of outward-facing stakes, with
half a hundred Durar Halberds sheltering
behind them. Beyond, under the eaves of a
forest thick with the corpses of hanged men,
was an army of horned creatures that were
more beast than man. Their damned bleating
cut right through Theodric’s mind. That wave
of heaving muscle and fur seemed to have a
thousand foul anatomies, united only by the
desire to rend and tear. Above them, the sky
was a livid weal of red against deep black.
One of the Durar Halberds,
furtively
searching for a way to escape this fresh
assault, caught sight of Theodric and his
fellow Hammers. His eyes went w ide.
‘We are saved!’ he shouted to his nearest
comrade, a man who looked on the verge of
panic.
‘The storm lords are here!’
Theodric took a deep breath, hefted his
broadsword high, and charged.

31

For the Sacrosanct Chamber’s
aether-mages, another
duty now lies beneath
their traditional role of the
guardians of the Anvil. These
warrior mages have been
despatched not only to protect
the strongholds and cities of
the Free Peoples, but to explore
those locations where the stuff
of eternity and the cycle of
life itself has been shaped or
manipulated. Their retinues
fight their way through layers
of antiquity to find fragments
of the truth, striking out for
some of the most lethal and
arcane sites in all the Mortal
Realms. They have been seen
in the amethyst sepulchres
of Shyish, the lost city of
Shadespire, those of the Jade
Kingdoms most synonymous
with rebirth, and a hundred
other esoteric locations besides.

Though not even their fellow
Stormcasts know it, these
crusaders have a holy task given
to them by Sigmar himself.
They search for the key to
reversing – or at least allaying
– the flaw in the immortality
of the Stormcast Eternals. They
are the greatest hope for the
warriors of the Heavens, for
in High Azyr the side-effects
of the reforging are becoming
steadily more pronounced.
If Sigmar’s crusade is to stay
true to the values that make
it righteous, his most eldritch
and arcane warriors absolutely
cannot fail.

‘To the mortal people of the realms

we are Sigmar’s avenging blades,

sent

to shatter

the chains that

bound them. But we are also figures

of terror. The spectacle of our attack

– and the charnel field

we leave in our wake – is fearsome.

For a time,

it ser ved our purposes

question and our path unbarred by

the concerns of simpler

folk. We

told each other, privately,

that we

Roar of the Heavens

32

ROAR OF THE HEAVENS

With hurricane force, Drakesworn Templars riding immense Stardrakes descend from on high,
waves of celestial energy surging before them, while the ground shakes beneath the thunderous
charge of the Dracothian Guard. This is the Extremis Chamber, heavy cavalr y of the Heavens.

Clad in sigmarite plate armour
and armed with weapons
wreathed in lightning, each
Stormcast is more than a match
for a dozen mortal warriors.
Yet such are the forces arrayed
against them – towering
monsters, mutated warriors
and daemons from the Realm
of Chaos – that sometimes even
the Warrior Chambers are not
enough to prevail. In those
direst of circumstances, against
the most powerful foes, there is
but one recourse: to deploy the
Extremis Chambers.

An Extremis Chamber strikes
much like a raging tempest,
each thunderclap charge
preceded by a lightning attack
that shatters enemy battle-lines
just as a bolt from the skies
shatters oak. This twofold
attack style has wrested
victory from defeat on scores
of battlefields.

First come two formations
of Dracothian Guard, each
warrior astride a storm-
spitting Dracoth. A shield of
shimmering force precedes
their charge, offering them
the protection of Sigmar’s
aura so they can reach their
targets at fu l l strength. The first
wave, known as the Lightning
Echelon, is comprised of
Fulminators and Tempestors
armed with line-breaking
lances and volley-firing
crossbows. After this force has
split apart the front ranks of
the enemy with bolts of energy,
the second wave hits home with
meteoric force. Taking their
long-hafted axes and hammers
to the reeling survivors, the
Desolators and Concussors
of the Thunderwave Echelon
make their presence known.

When enemy champions and
lords move in to rally their

broken armies, Drakesworn
Templars wing down from the
skies on Stardrakes, each of
the majestic beasts breathing
a thunderhead of crackling
energy as it crushes, stamps
and bites its way through the
helpless foe. Any still standing
are met blade-to-blade by
the beast’s noble rider – and
usually beheaded or impaled in
the process.

Envisioned by Sigmar and
Dracothion, the Extremis
Chambers were fashioned after
their own unique bond – a
pairing of man and star-
beast, indomitable warrior
and creature of great celestial
power. These formations were
devised as Order’s answer to
the greater daemons of Chaos
– they are forces that can lead
any attack, or cleanse any
battlefield. The charge of an
Extremis Chamber is intended
to be a spectacle of awe as well
as a potent weapon, instilling
fear in all who oppose the
might of the righteous.

It was Sigmar’s intention that
every Stormhost contain at
least one Extremis Chamber.
However,
the undertaking was
slow and oft delayed, for a soul-
deep bond between Stormcast
Eternal and celestial beast is
not easily forged. Not a single
Extremis Chamber was battle-
ready when Sigmar cast his first
lightning bolts into the Mortal
Realms, beginning his war to
overthrow the cruel tyranny of
the Chaos Gods.

It took time to find and reforge
the greatest of mankind’s
heroes, but securing the oaths
of Dracoths and Stardrakes
proved more difficult still.
In the past, the children of
Dracothion that died had
always been reincarnated
in the Heavens, their spirits
returning to new forms in a
process that initially inspired
the Stormcasts’ reforging.
However,
the influx of Chaos
was disrupting this age-old
cycle, for the tendrils of evil
were pushing through the
aether as well as into mortal
reality. Over time, the creatures
were becoming a dying race.

Dracothion feared the intrigues
of the Dark Gods, and so he
looked to the future as it was
written in the stars. The Great
Drake saw many evil portents,
reading signs of a looming
disaster. He saw hints that
foretold the machinations of
Archaon and the Dark Gods
coming to fruition unless the
Extremis Chambers could
halt them. Dracothion had
interpreted all his visions of
catastrophe through the lens of
one preoccupied with Chaos.
Perhaps,
if he had looked with
clearer eyes, he would also have
seen the deathly shadows that
lurked beneath these omens.

Driven by great urgency and
the unfolding spectacle of the
Realmgate Wars, Dracothion
visited Sigmaron, speeding
the creation of the Extremis
Chambers with his own
roaring bolts of celestial energy.
So did the Extremis Chambers
at last join the fray. First were
the Hammers Draconis of the
Hammers of Sigmar, but even
as they were sent to war, other
chambers were judged battle-
ready and unleashed upon the
enemies of Order.

The Blackbolts of the Anvils
of the Heldenhammer were
next to be forged, grim in deed
and aspect. In battle their
Dracoths shimmered darkly
like ominous thunderheads.
The Hammerclaws – another
chamber of the Hammers of
Sigmar – were amongst the
quickest of Extremis Chambers
to claim glory, defeating all
in the Gladitorium, while
the Chamber Resplendent
of the Hallowed Knights
brought Sigmar triumph in the
Ghurlands. The Storm Drakes
of the Tempest Lords laid
waste to the dreaded Skullfort,
demolishing it so thoroughly
that no two stones stood
atop each other, whilst the
Daughters Draconia crushed
the life from the corrupted
gargants of the Eversprawl.
And so the legends grew.

When the Extremis Chambers
are campaigning across the
realms, the High Star Sigendil
above Sigmaron burns bright,
blazing so that it is visible
even at midday. All those
who oppose the God-King
look up in the skies and curse
the brilliant blue light above
them. To them it is a hateful
reminder that one realm still
remains to be conquered, that
Sigmar has thus far escaped
his due. But to the oppressed,
the persecuted, the scattered
nomads driven from their
homes and pursued by minions
of the Dark Gods, the star’s
beams offer hope as well as
trepidation. The people whisper
that mighty Dracothion has
returned, that the stars ripple
with the movements of his
massive coils, and that he is
hungry. Word has travelled
across the realms, traders and
pioneers spreading the stories
– the knights of Sigmar now
ride upon fierce drakes that
can bite a man in half. It is said
by all who witness them they
breathe thunderclouds and call
down starfire to smite evil. So
does Dracothion’s
roar echo
Sigmar’s thunder, and bring
with it fearful majesty.

CHILDREN OF
DRACOTHION

In the Dracoths and Stardrakes,
the Stormcast Eternals have
found powerful allies in their
battle against Chaos. The
children of Dracothion are
mighty creatures, saturated with
celestial magic and eager to see
the Mortal Realms restored to
the reign of Order.

Across the realms,
legends
are told of the Great Drake,
Dracothion, Ruler of the Night
Sky, Hunter of the Azyrite
Cosmos. Long before the first
cities were raised, people and
beasts alike looked skywards.
The people of Azyr marvelled
at the beauty and order of the
stars, while the scions of Chaos
despised them, wishing to
strike down their loathsome
light. Many myths sprang up
about the Heavens, and how
the zodiacal godbeasts came
to call them home. There
dwelt Dracothion, a living
constellation writ large across
the black pall of eternity.

Primitive races across the
realms marked the outline of
Dracothion in the firmament.
To prophets, astromancers and
those gifted with witchsight,
something more than clusters
of celestial bodies could be
discerned. The keenest of
observers could pick out scales
that glinted like stars, or
perceive sinuous shifts that sent
ripples across the sky. More
tangible evidence of the Great
Drake, however, can be seen
throughout the realms in the
beasts known as his children.

It was during the most intense
starfalls that Dracothion’s
offspring descended from
the heavens. These were the
beasts known as Stardrakes
– creatures noble of aspect
and suffused with celestial
magic. Although they share
many characteristics with
dragons – for they have large
reptilian bodies, vast wings
and long serpentine necks –
the Stardrakes are something
altogether different. The beasts
shimmer with coruscating
energies; one moment they
radiate brilliant light, the
next they fade to the colour
of the night sky, a flickering
iridescence playing over their
dusky scales. It is this celestial
magic that gives them mystical
powers in addition to their
great physical strength.

Reclusive creatures, Stardrakes
tend to establish scattered
strongholds, always choosing
the most isolated locations.
Most favoured are the
realms’ highest places – the
eldest beasts nestle amidst
the peaks of the mightiest
mountain ranges. From these
lofty perches the Stardrakes
hunt each realm’s
sky-vault
or bask in its starlight. As
creatures of celestial magic,
they gain sustenance not only
from absorbing the light of
the Heavens, but also from
consuming the flesh of their
prey. With powerful claws
and fangs the size of blades,
Stardrakes can bring down
even the winged stymphalions
or zephyrgriffs that dwell
within the high atmosphere, or
swoop over mountain peaks in
pursuit of quarr y as large as a
thundertusk or grigordon.

Stardrakes wi l l attack any
creature of Chaos upon
sight, but wi l l never deign to
consume such foul fare. As
the offspring of Dracothion,
Stardrakes are creatures of
Order – the corruptions of
Chaos are anathema to them.
When they face those whose
souls are impure and riddled

with corruption, Stardrakes
can roar forth a devastating
thunderhead, or summon
blazing fires from the stars.

Though the Dracoths ridden
by the Dracothian Guard of
the Extremis Chambers are
smaller than the Stardrakes
they fight beside, their fierce
temperament and savage
instinct makes them deadly
indeed. Looming over even
the tallest of men, these
quadrupedal beasts absorb
celestial energies every night,
spitting them out as bolts of
crackling lightning in battle.
Dracoths hunt in packs, and
share their larger relatives’
hatred for Chaos. Unlike
Stardrakes, however, Dracoths
are primarily encountered
in the hinterlands of Azyr,
with only rare sightings of the
creatures in other realms.

The exact connection between
Dracoths and Stardrakes is
unknown. Some speculate
that Dracoths are distant
descendants of the Great
Drake, but there are some
Azyrite scholars who contend
that Dracoths are Stardrake
hatchlings, offspring that wi l l
one day return to the Heavens
to undergo a metamorphosis
amongst the stars.

It is known that Stardrakes and
Dracoths do not die as mortal
creatures do, but are instead

reincarnated. Their souls
return to the stars, and they
are born anew from the breath
of Dracothion. However, so
tainted has the aether become
by Chaos that the soul does not
always return to the Heavens,
and can remain trapped
indefinitely in the high places
of the realms.

Highly intelligent, Stardrakes
and Dracoths can soon learn
to understand the languages
of human, duardin and aelf,
although they speak exclusively
in their own inscrutable
tongue. During the Ages of
Myth and Chaos these celestial
creatures did not willing ly
engage with other races, save

only when they were united by
a common foe. Once a threat
was defeated, these temporary
alliances were abandoned as
the Dracoths or Stardrakes
returned to their isolated ways.
That changed with the coming
of the Stormcast Eternals.

Sigmar called upon the aid of
all creatures and gods of Order
to bring his greatest endeavour
to fruition. It was Dracothion
who first charged the Anvil of
the Apotheosis with the divine
energy needed for reforging
– for while Vulcatrix’s fire
burned hotter,
it was the magic
of the Great Drake’s bolt that
ensured her flames would burn
for eternity. Scr ying the future,
Dracothion saw that Sigmar’s
warriors would need more than
the strength of men to hurl
back the scions of Chaos. So it
was that Dracothion made a
pact with Sigmar, swearing that
those who proved themselves
worthy might form bonds with
his own children.

It was Lord-Celestant Vandus
Hammerhand of the Hammers
of Sigmar that was the first
Stormcast to tame a Dracoth.
Since that pioneering day,
hundreds more have followed
his example. Together,
the
combination of immortal
warrior, Dracoth and Stardrake
can stand against even the
mightiest of Chaos champions
and emerge victorious.

LORD-CELESTANT IMPERIUS

The leader of the Hammers Draconis is Lord-Celestant Imperius, a martial
strategist of incomparable skill born to lead in battle. Once a great mortal
emperor who gave ever ything to fight Chaos, his armies were broken after
betrayal by his own brother. Reforged, he would see his revenge exacted
as the Realmgate Wars raged on. His first great victory came at the
Gate of Sigmar, where he vanquished the Bloodthirster Kul’rhex.
Driven to fur y after the daemon mortally wounded his Stardrake
Loxia, the Lord-Celestant landed the blow that saw Kul’rhex sent
back to the Realm of Chaos, and took his foe’s burning crown. At
the head of the Hammers Draconis, Imperius led his echelons against
the Spined Hydra horde, and then went on to liberate the mountainous
bastions of Yjinxia,
long in the thra l l of Chaos. His defining moment,
however, came in the battle to reclaim the Brimfire All-gate. There he forged
a path through the Hell Breach, and though he was finally cut down by the
infamous Skarbrand, his sacrifice won the day for the Stormcast Eternals.

Hunters of the Damned

HUNTERS OF THE DAMNED

The celestial winds rise to a joyous howl as the Stormcast Rangers race across the Mortal Realms.
The keen eyes of the these swift warriors guide pinpoint strikes and razored blades, each sudden
assault slaying the scions of the darkness with ruthless strength and speed.

The Rangers of the Vanguard
Auxi liar y Chambers play a
vital part in Sigmar’s plan for
the Mortal Realms. It is they
who locate and exploit the
weaknesses in the God-King’s
foes. A barbarian horde harried
by these expert trackers wi l l
find its rearguard dwindling
with every passing night, its
own outriders and champions
led into ambushes from which
there is no escape. When only
the veterans at the enemy’s
front line are left, enraged
and all but unsupported, the
Rangers wi l l close in for the
final assault – for though they
fight with intellect first and

blade later,
they are all expert
combatants well-versed in the
arts of war.

Though few mortal souls are
aware of their existence, the
Rangers have roamed the
lands of the realms ever since
Sigmar’s Tempest first struck
out at the Chaos armies.
The most well-known are
the Vanguard-Hunters and
Vanguard-Raptors
that act
as rank-and-file troops for
their Lord-Aquilors, and the
Vanguard-Palladors
that ride
swift Gryph-chargers to war.
Theirs is not the bombastic
charge of the Extremis

Chambers, nor the shield-
wall and aerial assault of the
Strike Chambers, but instead a
shifting and fluid style of war
designed to wrong-foot the foe.

The Stormcast Rangers spend
little time in the mountain
fastnesses near Sigmaron, nor
do they attend war councils
unless specifically called.
Their homes are deep in
the wilderness. They roam
the hinterlands of shattered
civilisations for years,
living off
the land and resting only when
the nearest threat is leagues
distant. Since the ascendance of
Chaos, such times are rare.


PAGEBREAK
37

The Rangers have many bases
of operations, making use
of far-flung war lodges and
humble way stations more
akin to tumbled shrines from
the Age of Myth than the
towering Stormkeeps that
protect Sigmar’s cities of Order.
In these remote places, the
Rangers largely evade detection
from those that would hunt
them in turn.

Though they place great value
on guile and preparation,
when the Stormcast Rangers
attack they do so not as the
assassin that slinks in the dark,
but with the fu l l glory of a
raging typhoon. By attacking
the enemy from afar, quickly
striking down exposed
elements, and then moving
away as swift as a zephyr,
the Rangers spur the enemy
commander into revealing

their weaknesses – or frittering
away their troops in a series of
unwinnable fights.

Such is the skill and ferocity of
the Rangers that few foes have
lived to see them first-hand.
Among the slave camps and
warbands of Chaos, rumours
run rife with speculation about
the nature of these elusive and
deadly warriors. Some servants
of the Dark Gods believe
the Rangers to be elemental
creatures of lightning and wind
– the Wyndstalkers Chamber,
for instance,
is said to be able to
change form before the startled
eyes of their prey. Others claim
they are an embodiment of the
lands tormented by the Dark
Gods – that each one is the
ghost of a fallen soldier, forged
from righteous hatred and
risen from the tortured earth to
tear apart the invader.

In truth, the Rangers are
Stormcast Eternals – reforged
from mortal clay into the form
of tempest-borne warriors – but
they are creatures of sigmarite,
flesh and blood all the same.
Bonds of kinship have been
forged with their fellow
chambers, and even between
Stormhosts, for victory has a
way of binding warriors as one,
and adversity even more so.

When the sworn enemies of
Sigmar gather in great number,
these elite pathfinders wi l l fight
as Ranger Brotherhoods, or
even as part of a wider alliance
of chambers. To fight alongside
them in battle is seen as a great
honour. Of all Stormcasts,
the Rangers are most attuned
to the lands they reclaim and
the struggles of those who live
there – and this makes them
deadly warriors indeed.


PAGEBREAK
STORMHOSTS

The Stormhosts have an underlying
structure that unites them one and
all. However,
the remits Sigmar laid
down were designed to be flexible and
open-ended, so that his legions might
better adapt to the changing face of war.
For instance, a great influx of eagle-
winged heroes saved from a ravaged sky
kingdom might result in a Stormhost
with a far larger Harbinger Chamber
than usual.

The Hammers of Sigmar are known
for having an extensive Extremis
Chamber ; their lords were first to forge
the bond between man and Dracoth,
and the children of Dracothion trust
them implicitly. The Anvils of the
Heldenhammer have several Relictor
Temples, known informally as Black
Sepulchres, whereas the bombastic
Astral Templars are famed for the
number of monster-slaying Paladins
in their Exemplar Chambers and their
reliance on the mounted warriors of the
Vanguard Chambers.

Differences can manifest even at the
chamber level. The Royal Victrians
of the Tempest Lords, for instance,
fight only with hammers – as they
did in mortal life – with the singular
exception of the bearer of the
chamber’s grandblade.

Though all Stormhosts pay obeisance
to Sigmar’s edicts, there is but one core
principle they adhere to: that which they
find is most effective in the fight against
the darkness shall be their guiding light.

The Stormbolt

Incarnate

THE STORMBOLT INCARNATE

The Stormhosts have a clear structure, but in practice are often organised as necessity demands.
All are led into battle by seasoned commanders who combine the role of lord, champion and
master strategist alike – but even these paragons are not immune to the vagaries of war.

Each Stormcast Eternals
chamber is an independent
army unto itself. Its
commanders are given
authority by Sigmar,
their
remit to wrest victory from
the armies of evil warlords
and consolidate those gains
in whatever way they see fit.
That said, each Stormhost’s
command structure has
similarities in the way it is
organised, commonalities of
hierarchy that mean a chamber
from one Stormhost wi l l
appear much like its equivalent
in another when a crusade
is first gathered in the halls
of Sigmaron.

Ultimately, each chamber is a
meritocracy. It has been shorn
of the politics and back-biting
of a mortal institution – such
pettiness has no place in a
shield-wall that must stand
firm against the hordes of
Chaos, or an arcane cabal

that faces the mind-twisting
sorceries of the Dark Gods.
If a Stormcast Eternal proves
wise in the ways of a particular
enemy, or hails from the land
in which the chamber seeks
to do battle, his superiors wi l l
listen closely to his advice
without bias.

If an individual shows true
promise – demonstrating
outstanding quality of the
mind and soul, as well as the
body – they wi l l be elevated
to a new rank upon their next
reforging. This is no simple
promotion, no battlefield edict
that conveys authority alone,
but a holistic transformation
that sees their soul energised
even further by the magic
of Azyr. A Liberator-Prime
that defends a fortress city
for months against the most
horrific siege weapons might be
reforged as a Lord-Castellant
after giving his life to repel

the enemy in the final assault.
Similarly, a Sequitor or
Castigator who banishes every
gheist that crosses her path and
devotes many sleepless nights
to learning the lore of undeath
may be reforged as a Lord-
Exorcist. Such individuals are
not always accepted as easily
in the chamber command as
those Sigmar judged born to
the role, but in most instances
their exceptional quality soon
proves they have found their
true place.

It is not the way of a Strike
Chamber’s commanders to
sit back whilst their men
fight and die on their behalf.
Instead, they lead from the
front, as inspiring to their
kin as they are frightening
to their enemies. Such heroic
individuals are colloquially
known as the Lords of the
Storm. It is they that take
on the direst of foes blade-

A BAND OF BROTHERS

Stormcast Eternals are not only mighty
warriors, they are also tacticians, expert in the
sciences and crafts of war. When confronted
with an unusual or seemingly insurmountable
objective, the Stormhost’s
leader, or one of
his subordinate lords, wi l l muster an ad-hoc
formation designed to complete that specific
task or achieve that particular goal.

The most common temporary bands
of warriors are formations known as
brotherhoods. Brotherhoods may include units
selected from across a number of different
chambers. Most often, the exact composition
of a brotherhood is carefully planned to ensure
its mission has the best chance of success, but
there have been many occasions when they
have been assembled in the heat of battle – to
exploit an unfolding tactical opportunity
or to seize the initiative from the foe. Some
simply consist of the survivors of a far larger
contingent, given common cause in the name
of sur viva l.

The first force of Stormcasts to enter
the Mortal Realms was a Thunderstrike
Brotherhood of the Hammerhands, who
took on the infamous Goretide to seize the
realmgate of the Brimstone Peninsula. Led
by Lord-Celestant Vandus and Lord-Relictor
Ionus Cryptborn, it was a cross-section of
every conclave in the Hammerhands Warrior
Chamber – though small in size, it proved
devastating in impact. Since then, a hundred
variants have sprung up in its wake, giving the
Stormhosts even more flexibility.

Not all Stormcast warrior groups are called
brotherhoods. Sometimes they are known as
forces or wings – depending on the specific
constituent parts of their chamber – but in
function they are much the same. Not all are
led by a member of the chamber command;
in fact it is common for a brotherhood, force
or wing to be so tight-knit it effectively leads
itself, with the primes of each retinue acting as
arbiters and decision-makers in times when a
higher level of leadership is needed.


PAGEBREAK
41

to-blade, who stand before
monsters that shake the earth
with their tread, and who
plunge fearlessly into the
unknown horizons of each
Realmgate without hesitation.
Because of their selfless
heroism, it is often the officers
of a chamber’s command that
have been reforged the most,
giving their lives in battle only
to be sent back into the fray
over and over again.

The side effects of this cycle
of war, death and rebirth
mean the leaders of each
chamber become exemplars
of that which their Stormhost
embodies, each a living
incarnation of Sigmar’s
divine will. The officers of
the Hallowed Knights, for
instance, number amongst
them saintly figures that glow
with an inner light – this
radiance becomes stronger
with each act of martyrdom
until it literally shines through
the joints in their armour.
Many leaders of the Knights
Excelsior,
infamous for the

obsessive vigour with which
they scour the taint of Chaos
from the lands,
literally view
the world in a monochromatic
schema of good and evil, and
claim they can perceive intent
as well as action. Some of the
vengeful
lords of the Celestial
Vindicators find their endless
ire burning around them in a
tangible aura when they charge
headlong into the enemy,
trailing blue flame like the
tail of a meteor. Some exhibit
even stranger manifestations;
it is said that Lord-Celestant
Ossiach Vanderghule of the
Anvils of the Heldenhammer
is surrounded by wisps of
amethyst energy that resemble
tiny ethereal haemonculi, and
that a new phantasm appears
after his every reforging.

The changes that these leaders
undergo are not all obvious.
In their minds, those amongst
them that have become
transfigured have long ago
departed the realm of human
emotion and morality. Some
embrace the cold, ana lytica l

perspective of one who looks
down from on high, literally as
well as metaphorically. Others
rail against the change, doing
ever ything in their power
to hold onto the traditions,
cultural
idiosyncrasies and
even indulgences that once
made them who they were –
and, in the process, influencing
the warriors of their respective
chambers to do the same.

Even with these exemplars
of the Stormhosts there is no
predictable outcome from
repeated reforgings. The more
esoteric the transfiguration,
the
more the unwanted reputation
of the Stormcast Eternals
spreads – that they are no
longer recognisably human.
All that is known for sure is
that these lords epitomise
Sigmar’s divine power more
than any other. They embody
not only the blessings of the
tempest’s mantle, but also
the side-effects that take the
Stormcasts ever further from
the simple mortality that was
once their birthright.

BRETHREN OF SIGMARITE

Brethren of Sigmarite

There are countless formations of Stormcast Eternals at war across the Mortal Realms, each expert
in its own field. Some have become renowned as especially effective or viable forces – so much so
that every Stormhost has since adopted them to further Sigmar’s crusade.

Some brotherhoods fight
alongside one another for so
long they become de facto
organisations in their own
right. If they are on campaign
for years or even decades at
a time they may find it hard
to remember what it was to
be a part of a larger chamber
or Stormhost. Amongst
such factions it has become
common practice to wear some
manner of visual identifier
or amended heraldry to
show the nigh familial bond
between its members. Any
source of strength that helps
a brotherhood prosper and
feel united is adopted without
much resistance.

Examples of such divergent
heraldry are many and various,
but they usually have their
roots in tribal practices or the
heritage of the brotherhood’s
mortal incarnations. The
Masters of the Theanic Maze
have tattooed square-spiral
bands on their sigmarite plate
ever since their transfigured
leader Ehlor Maracastus
covered his armour head to toe
in such designs. The Brethren
of the Scarlet Stratum, hailing
from the Ghurish Hinterlands,
paint a red stripe across their
eyes – and across the eyes of
their masks – to represent the
layer of bloody corpse-clay laid
down in their ancestral
lands
after the massacre of their
forefathers. The Brotherhood
of Grey Paladins purposefully
discolours its sigmarite plate
with the ash of fire-walking
rituals after every battle. In
such ways do the brotherhoods
of the Stormcasts bind
themselves closer and keep the
memories of their pasts alive –
for though none openly admit
it, if they did not do so, those
histories and identities might
slip away all the faster.

HAMMERSTRIKE
FORCE

The Hammerstrike Force
hinges around a retinue
of veteran Prosecutors.
Descending from the clouds in
a blaze of light, these winged
warriors dive like eagles on
the hunt, targeting key enemy
formations or command
positions. They hurl their
celestial hammers from on high
before the foe can even prepare
themselves for the onslaught.

Just as the enemy musters
its counter-attack,
the two
retinues of Paladins that form
the core of the force strike with
devastating power. These are
often Retributors armed with
lightning hammers or starsoul
maces, the better to lay low the
enemy commanders in a single
devastating assault.

THUNDERHEAD
BROTHERHOOD

Comprised of line infantr y
from the Redeemer and Justicar
Conclaves, the Thunderhead
Brotherhood is intended as
a defensive blockade that is
almost impossible to shift.
Three retinues of Liberators
form a bulwark of burnished
metal, standing shoulder-
to-shoulder and turning
their pauldrons to bolster
the glacis of their shield-
wall. Behind them wait two
retinues of Judicators,
ideally
in a slightly elevated position,
their bowstrings drawn and
arrows nocked ready to loose
their deadly projectiles over
the heads of their Liberator
brethren. Any who charge the
shieldwall are riddled with
crackling arrows – those that
survive the volley wi l l
likely
rebound from the Liberators’
shields before being put down
for good.

VANGUARD WING

A Vanguard Wing operates
on a similar basis to the
Hammerstrike Force, but with
the additional ranged element
of a retinue of Judicators.
Able to strike from above
as well as on ground level, a
Vanguard Wing can turn a
grinding stalemate into a rout
in seconds. The Liberators and
Judicators that form the force’s
core are empowered by their
Prosecutor allies, their weapons
becoming even more potent as
they methodically eliminate
the enemy army. Then their
winged fellows roam wide in
search of future targets.

DEVASTATION
BROTHERHOOD

The Devastation Brotherhood
comprises mainly Paladins,
the most heavily armed
of all Stormcast infantry,
for this force’s purpose is
raw destruction. They are
accompanied to war by
Judicators and Prosecutors,
who pin the brotherhood’s
chosen target in place with a
rain of deadly missiles as the
heavier retinues close in. When
the Paladins finally charge,
they do so with such crushing,
unstoppable power that they
leave only smouldering embers
where enemy warriors stood
moments before.

SOULSTRIKE
BROTHERHOOD

Combining the Vanguard
Chamber’s Rangers and
the arcane specialists of the
Sacrosanct Chamber,
the
Soulstrike Brotherhoods
were founded in response to
the aftermath of the Shyish
necroquake. This brotherhood
is essentially a scouting force
reinforced by heavily armed


PAGEBREAK
43

warriors who join the battle
swiftly when the mobile
element judges it the right time
for the death blow to land. It
has proved highly effective
against small-scale daemon
incursions and other unnatural
targets, but it is at its best when
hunting the roaming packs of
Nighthaunts that now plague
the lands.

The Soulstrike Brotherhood’s
vanguard elements harr y the
foe until it turns to launch
a punitive assault, at which
point these outriders summon
retinues of Castigators, along
with Sacristan Engineers
that man powerful Celestar
Ballistas. Soon enough what
seems like a lone band of
skirmishers is revealed to be
the core of a force of magical
artillery, so redolent with
celestial magic it can reduce
ethereal foes to wisps of
nothingness in moments.

HAILSTORM BATTERY

When the Stormcast Eternals
have need of devastating
firepower – for instance, when
they face a stubborn foe that
thrives at close quarters but
struggles to make its mark
at range – the Hailstorm
Battery is brought to bear.
Under the supervision of a
Lord-Ordinator,
the crew of
a Celestar Ballista focus their
fire on targets picked out by a
front line of Castigators. The
deadly power unleashed by the
Castigators and the heavenly
stormbolts that slam home
soon afterward form a double
assault powerful enough to fell
even a rampaging Mutalith.

GRAND
CONVOCATION

The Grand Convocations of
the Sacrosanct Chambers are
concentrations of eldritch
mastery like no other.

Consisting of a Lord-Arcanum,
his most trusted Knights-
Incantor and a Lord-Exorcist,
they are able to combine their
mystical abilities to pull in
Azyrite magic from leagues
around. In doing so they ensure
every spell they cast, from the
merest cantrip to the most
ambitious living spell, is an
unstoppable force.

CLEANSING PHALANX

The Cleansing Phalanx is
designed to withstand masses
of ethereal foes so thick they
appears to gather like fog. Its
Evocators can channel power to
their Sequitor brethren so their
every strike is guided by the
might of the Heavens. Maces
and swords hit home in bursts
of scintillating blue-white
power even as the Evocators
join the fight. At battle’s end,
all that remains of the foe is a
troubling memory.

Hammers of Sigmar

HAMMERS OF SIGMAR

The Golden Ones, First

to the Fray, Sigmar’s Champions

The first of the Stormhosts to be hurled into the Mortal Realms, the Hammers of Sigmar bleed and
die each day in the name of Sigmar. Figureheads of the new order, they bear the responsibility that
comes with that honour with strength and nobility.

Of all the Stormhosts, the
Hammers of Sigmar have seen
the most battles in the name of
the God-King; time and time
again they are sent from the
forges of the Sigmarabulum
to the front lines of the grand
war against Chaos. They know
little of peace, for they are
ever in the thick of battle.
They would have it no
other way.

This constant
combat has
earned the
Stormhost
many an
accolade

since the time of the Realmgate
Wars. When the Free Peoples
speak of the Stormcast
Eternals,
it is usually the
Hammers of Sigmar to which
they refer. Many are the statues
raised to them. The Brimstone
Peninsula, where the Hammers
first wrested victory from the
Goretide of Korghos Khul, has
a great memorial to those who
lost their souls to the scions
of the Blood God that day,
with a statue of the lost Lord-
Celestant Jactos Goldenmane
at its top. Similar honours
and monuments can be seen
across the realms – the free
cities of Aqshy and beyond
depict their victories, the
better to immortalise them
and give thanks for Sigmar’s
blessings. Basilicas and palaces
are adorned with mosaics and
friezes inlaid with gold leaf

imported from Chamon’s most
glorious forests, and every
minstrel or raconteur knows
the songs and tales of their
greatness. These warriors are
rarely seen in the civilised
hearts of the new cities, for
the war against Chaos out
in the wilds is never-ending.
When the transfigured of the
Hammers of Sigmar walk
amongst those they protect,
they seem to mortal eyes to
be gilded statues from some
fantastical dynasty given life,
impassive beings of lightning
and sigmarite that have more in
common with angels than men.

For many of their number,
that description is becoming
more and more true with
every reforging. Those who
fight ceaselessly in the name
of Sigmar risk death every
day, and most have been
killed more than once. The
Hammers of Sigmar are often
reforged in haste so that they
may rejoin the war – and
perhaps even bolster their kin
to tip the balance in the same
protracted engagement that
saw them fall. Some amongst
them, Lord-Celestant Vandus
Hammerhand included, have
begun to pay the price for this
constant cycle of life and death.

The effects of these reforgings
are becoming ever more
noticeable, whether to their
Stormcast brethren or the
people they seek to save. Those
who have been reincarnated
too many times are afflicted
with celestial visions, bear
blazes of crackling lightning
around their heads or manifest
celestial energy in their fists
when their temper runs hot.
Such phenomena do not go
unmarked, and only reinforce


PAGEBREAK
45

the rumours that, though
mighty,
the Hammers of
Sigmar are not human at all.

As one of the largest of the
Stormhosts, the Hammers of
Sigmar can call upon every
type of tempest-forged warrior
Sigmar has created for his
crusade. They have the largest
Extremis Chamber of all their
kind, for even the godbeast
Dracothion has learned of their
valour, and blessed them with
the aid of many of his Stardrake
and Dracoth children. They are
the militar y machine around
which all other Stormhosts are
modelled, and hence are by
their nature formal and rigid.
They have trained so long in
the Gladitorium that they
intuitively form phalanxes,
battle-lines, shield-walls and
circular perimeters as one,
and can adopt more complex
formations at a single shouted
word from the lords in their
midst. Every warrior has a
knack for tactics, and knows
how best to support his fellows.

The Hammers of Sigmar fear
nothing – nothing except
that which they might one
day become, and the notion
of their own failure. Every
man, woman and child across
the realms looks to them for
salvation, and they cannot be
found wanting. In the Mortal
Realms, hope is a fragile thing
indeed; the Hammers believe
if even a single rumour spreads
suggesting that they are not
equal to their task, it may
undermine Sigmar’s entire
endeavour. This fear of failure
leads many of the Hammers
of Sigmar’s commanders to
drive their warriors on against
impossible odds, when a more
pragmatic leader might have
conserved his resources or
withdrawn for the sake of
caution. Though this dogged
refusal to concede the field has
ended in calamity when the
odds against them stack high, it
has also seen victory snatched
from the jaws of defeat. Those
men and women saved by such

incredible acts of fortitude are
so thunderstruck, so grateful,
they tell the tale of their awe-
inspiring saviours whenever
the opportunity arises. And
so the legend of the Hammers
spreads ever further.

As the cities of Sigmar’s new
order rise high, the Hammers
face enemies who cannot be
laid low with force of arms.
The expectations and desires of
city leaders are of little import
to the Lord-Celestants,
for
they answer only to Sigmar
and the Celestant-Prime. With
every petty noble or arrogant
princeling they snub, they earn
another enemy – and they have
more than enough already.
Many a determined Stormcast
Eternal has fallen not to the
axes of Chaos, but to the blades
of assassins paid to remove
them from the path of an
ambitious lordling who prefers
to rule on his own terms.
Such schemers may well find
a Judicator or Lord-Veritant
at their door, whereupon
their souls wi l l be weighed,
measured and found wanting –
for even the corruption hidden
in the hearts of noble men must
be burned out if the Hammers
of Sigmar are to succeed in
their duty to the God-King.

The spiritual
leader of the
Hammers of Sigmar is the
Celestant-Prime. Though
that demigod-like figure
is in many ways the lord
of all the Stormhosts, the
Hammers claim him as their
own – he was the first of all
Stormcast Eternals,
just as their
Stormhost was the first to be
forged. The Hammers strive
to be like him in all that they
do. Perhaps,
in doing so, they
unconsciously hasten their
journey towards becoming
creatures of the storm.

‘First

to be Forged, Never

to Fail ’

- Battle cry of

the

Hammers of Sigmar

HAMMERHAL

It was the Hammers
of Sigmar who first
captured the Realmgate
around which the city
of Hammerhal
is built.
Thirty chambers struck
at both sides of that
gateway, battling the orruk
tribes who worshipped
it. Only after long years
of fighting – and with
the aid of the Hallowed
Knights, the Anvils of
the Heldenhammer and
several other Stormhosts
– did Sigmar’s warriors
at last defeat the orruk
scourge. To the Hammers
of Sigmar went the
honour of raising the
first Stormkeeps. A
cadre of Lord-Relictors
caged the energies of the
Stormrift gate, building
elaborate machineries
to harness the volatile
sorcerous emanations.
In Hammerhal Aqsha,
those wrathfu l energies
power a vast shield of
flickering lightning, while
in Hammerhal Ghyra
they are funnelled into
protective wards.

By day, thousands of
airships, skycutters and
lava-cogs make their
way to the city’s trading
districts, and the rift-
docks echo to the sounds
of sailors and labourers
shifting a bewildering
array of exotic cargo and
livestock. The common
people tend to be hardy,
practical folk, well-
muscled and sun-beaten
from many years of
physical toil. They gain
no renown and earn little
wealth from this onerous
existence, but it is the
tireless exertion of the
God-King’s people as
much as the power and
might of his Stormhosts
that keeps the wheels of
his empire in motion.

HALLOWED KNIGHTS

The Faithful,

the Silver Saviours,

Hallowed Knights

the Soul Guardians

The Hallowed Knights are holy crusaders all. Their inner strength and purity of spirit is legendary.
They fervently believe in Sigmar’s supremacy, and pray to him day and night for the strength to
smite his enemies. They were made to suffer the woes of each of the worlds, and to overcome them.

Zealous beyond measure,
loyal
beyond question, the Hallowed
Knights are driven to fight
with unrelenting fervour.
They consider the war against
Chaos to be a sacred quest
for which no sacrifice is too
great. The Hallowed Knights
were the fourth Stormhost to
be founded, and have a strong
religious culture, valuing
prayer, ritual and hymns of
praise so highly that even
Sigmar himself has expressed
unease at the intensity of their
worship for him. The first
canticle of their kindred –
‘Much is demanded of those to
whom much is given’ – guides
them in all that they do, for
they do not take the privilege of
Sigmar’s strength lightly.

The Hallowed Knights are
selfless warriors that go to
battle in burnished silver
armour accented with rich
gold and the royal blue of the
heavens. Though they set off to
war in raiment that glitters like
a pure stream in the summer
sun, it is never long before that
shining sigmarite is clotted,
discoloured, bloodstained,
and smeared with filth. For
these warriors do not shy away
from that which needs to be
done, and willing ly fight the
direst foes in the most hostile
environments imaginable –
indeed, they seek them out, and
wi l l never baulk at plunging
into jeopardy in order to pierce
the rotten heart of Chaos with
their blades. It is said that
more than one amongst them
has strayed into the hellscape
of Nurgle’s Garden, and some
have even emerged from the
trial alive – traumatised, but
somehow still sane, and even
more determined in their duty
to cleanse the realms.

No matter how sullied or
tarnished these warriors
become, their souls have thus
far remained spotless and
strong. So formidable is their
wi l l that evil magic cannot
easily gain purchase upon
them. Some amongst the free
warriors of Azyr have reported
seeing the mutative energies
of Chaos running from the
Hallowed Knights’ armour as if
it were no more dangerous than
brackish sludge.

In some Hallowed Knights
chambers it has become
their custom to wear,
locked
away in a reliquary or casket,
the remnants of something
unutterably foul – perhaps
the severed finger of a Putrid
Blightking, or even a Nurgle-
thorn plucked from the
legendary Lord-Celestant
Gardus’ armour after his return
from the Realm of Chaos.
The reasoning goes that if the
wearer can withstand the vile
energies of such a thing, they
can prove their soul’s purity
beyond a doubt. By hardening
their resolve each day, they
are made all but immune to
the rot that might otherwise
overwhelm them.

There are those who have
contracted a sickness or blight
from the Plaguefather’s cursed
diseases, but whose bodies are
so imbued with the energies of
Azyr that their flesh constantly
burns itself clean in a process
of rot and renewal that leaves
them heavily scarred on the
outside, but still pure within.
Some find their armour melded
with their flesh by the cycle of
purge and infection, and spend
their days in constant agony –
small wonder they are always
amongst those who volunteer

for the most desperate and
dangerous theatres of battle.
They fear no evil and welcome
a martyr’s death, for their trust
in the God-King is absolute.

In the minds of these most
faithful warriors, to be reforged
is to be distilled into an ever
cleaner, ever purer life-form,
getting closer to the God-King
with each rebirth. Those who
have been reforged many times
in Sigmar’s service – of which
the humble Lord-Celestant
Gardus is unquestionably
the most holy – might have a
nimbus-like halo, or emit a
lambent celestial light from the
chinks in their armour as their
inner radiance shines out.

Since Alarielle gave her blessing
to the Hallowed Knights during
the Realmgate Wars,
there has
been talk of a glowing figure
sighted in and around their
foremost Stormkeeps. Known
only as the Silvered Saint, this
androgynous, feather-winged
being appears in reflections and
even bodies of water to lend its
blessing to those afflicted by
doubt in times of great need.

On several occasions the
blazing white fires of the
Hallowed Knights’ zeal have
guttered in the face of Chaos,
but they have never been truly
extinguished. They have a
sacred duty as the spiritual
guardians of the Free Peoples
and they would fight the same
battles a hundred times over if
called upon to do so. With their
grand war effort coordinated
from the Shining Citadel, their
principal Stormkeep in the
Aqshian city of Hallowheart,
they bring justice and zeal to
every land befouled by the
worst excesses of Chaos.

F arrus of the Gifted Dawn knelt in prayer in a clearing
he had found deep in the Vilewoad. The ground was
marshy, stinking of mildew, and the forest’s matted,
tentacular canopy clawed at a gibbous moon. Around him he
could hear the droning chants and malevolent g iggles of the
plague daemons, but as was the way of their kind, they were
in no hurry. They would eat his soul soon enough, or so they
said over and over. Yet still he lived – albeit covered in muck,
tired to the bone, and bleeding.
Inspired by a shaft of moonlight that had penetrated the
clearing, Farrus had unfastened the triptych upon his back
and set it so that all twelve Ordeals of Lord Gardus were
v isible in the moonlight. At the relic’s
top, the Silvered Saint
glinted,
its numinous form unblemished.
‘Who shall overcome every trial? ’ said Farrus softly. The
Nurglings at the edge of the clearing, growing bold at the
sight of his downed weapons, chor tled wetly in answer.
‘No-one, no-one!’ they said.
Farrus ignored them.
‘Who will bring the light of Sigmar to
the darkest places? ’ he said.
‘Not a soul, not a soul!’ came the singsong reply as the
Nurglings spilled forward. In their wake came bloated
Plaguebearers, bandy-legged and leering.
‘Who will smite the daemon and the fiend? ’ said Farrus
slowly, his voice growing more strident as he reverently
stowed the triptych and picked up his hammer and sword.
The weapons burned with white fire at his touch, and the
closest daemons shrieked in horror as the flames consumed
them. Farrus strode forward, his weapons sinking into
daemon flesh as the war cry of the Hallowed Knights leapt
from his lips.
‘Only the faithful!’

LORD GARDUS

There are none in Sigmar’s hosts more devout
than Lord-Celestant Gardus, the Steel Soul. So
strong and pure is his spiritual fortitude that
the curse of the daemon can gain no purchase
upon him. At the advent of the Realmgate
Wars, Sigmar sent Gardus to battle the hordes
of Nurgle at the Gates of Dawn, but even
he did not realise just how sorely the Lord-
Celestant would be tested. Gardus alone was
to pass through those gates,
leading the Great
Unclean One known as Bolathrax away from
his men and into the Realm of Chaos itself.
Though his ordeal would have shattered the
sanity of any mortal man, Gardus emerged
with his mind and soul intact, and in doing
so helped forge an alliance with the Sylvaneth
that lasts to this day.

The qualities of honour, duty and sacrifice run
so deep in Gardus they have come to define
him. Even as a mortal man, when the Lord-
Celestant was merely Garradan of Demesnus,
his quiet strength was the foundation for an
entire community of healers. He worked for

many long years to bring succour to the sick
and the cursed of Demesnus Harbour, never
putting his own needs above those of his flock.
Not once did he contract an ailment from
the moss-lepers and mildewed starvelings he
tended. Though many suspected it, his true
calling only became clear when the hospice of
Grand Lazzar was attacked by the madmen of
the Skinstealer tribe.

With a four-foot iron candlestick in each
hand, Garradan went about the defence of
his colony. Blood spattered white sheets once
more, spilled not in the name of mercy, but in
anger. When Garradan was finally put down
by a spear thrust from behind, he fell with a
prayer on his lips. It was a plea to the stars,
a last request for the strength to smite those
with cruelty in their souls. Sigmar listened
well, and Garradan was taken up to Azyr to be
given a new life. Seeing the mark of greatness,
Sigmar immediately elevated Gardus to the
status of Lord-Celestant – a rank he has since
earned a dozen times over.

Celestial Vindicators

CELESTIAL VINDICATORS

The Vengeful,

the Hate-fuelled,

the Hurricane of Blades

The Celestial Vindicators are vengeance incarnate. Their hearts burn with an enmity for Chaos
that knows no bounds. To witness them in battle is to see a hurricane of razored sigmarite break
upon the foe until nothing is left alive, for these bladesmen value neither mercy nor restraint.

As mortals, each of the
warriors that would become
the Celestial Vindicators had
prayed to Sigmar whilst still
soaked in the blood of the
enemy. They did not pray to be
saved, avenged or transported
to safety. Instead they implored
the powers above for strength
enough to smite those who had
wronged them. They were not
given their retribution then
and there, but snatched up to
the Heavens. Since that day
they have become a part of
something much larger – the
raging typhoon of war that
Sigmar unleashes on his foes.

Sixth to be founded, the
Celestial Vindicators are
born in wrath. Uniquely,
during their reforging, the
Celestial Vindicators have to
pass through the towering
Sturmdrang Gate. To brave
the black fire of that portal is
an ordeal unto itself, and only
souls whose hatred burns with
the heat of an Aqshian furnace
can hope to survive. Many do
not return. Those who make it
through are given a measure of
the holy rage that roared like
a caged lion in the heart of the
God-King himself during the
Long Wait.

By chanting grim war songs,
the Celestial Vindicators are
able to channel their fury. They
find focus in repeating the
same chapter and verse aloud
with their fellows. In the heat
of combat, however,
their hate
becomes a wildfire that cannot
be extinguished, consuming all
rational thought – it is said that
a silent Celestial Vindicator is
the most terrifying of all, for he
speaks with actions alone.

The Vindicators’ close-knit
brotherhoods are so united in
their burning hatred of Chaos
that their phalanxes attack like


PAGEBREAK
49

natural disasters given form.
Once unleashed upon the foe,
they wi l l typically advance
regardless of wider strategy,
hacking down the enemy with
great fur y until the last spark
has been extinguished from
their bodies. Many are the
times when their fur y leads to
recklessness, causing them to
press too deeply into the foe,
but the intensity of that same
fur y can see them fight clear
once more.

The Lord-Celestants of the
Celestial Vindicators believe
the best way to triumph over
Chaos is with unrestrained
force of arms. They always lead
from the front, using their
armies as line-breaker forces
to sunder the most resolute
enemy battle-lines so that the
wider hosts of Order might win
victory in their wake. Those
who follow in their stead have
often compared the sight before
them to a field of corn being
reaped by a thousand blades,
with every fallen stalk the
hacked-open body of a warrior
who stood against them.

Each Stormcast of the
Celestial Vindicators has a
tale of atrocity and madness
from their past that drives
them ever onward. This gives
them an incredible force of
personality – it is said that
some Celestial Vindicators
can melt copper with the
intensity of their stare. It also
makes them single-minded,
and perhaps even blinkered,
and those who have been
extensively reforged fight more
like wrecking balls or battering
rams than astute tacticians.
The lessons of cooperation
and patience taught to them
in the Gladitorium are often
lost to the pure, driving power
of rage. Some say they seek to
become living weapons, and
that they revere a figure known
as the Father of Blades – an
impassive animus comprised
of the steel-spirits of twelve
ancient duardin runeswords
that were gifted to Sigmar’s

chosen chieftains in aeons long
past. Whatever the truth, their
kinship with the blade is clear
to all who witness them. Many
Celestial Vindicators wield a
blade in each hand, the better
to reap a high tally.

The Stormhost’s
tendency
to descend into monomania
is exemplified in the tragic
history of the slain Lord-
Celestant Thostos Bladestorm,
whose bravery and skill is
commemorated in a hundred
statues across the free cities of
the realms. It was Thostos that
first located Ghal Maraz in the
Eldritch Fortress of Anvrok
and fought to retrieve it, in the
process becoming transmuted
into a form of living metal
before being finally slain by
anarchic Tzeentchian magic.
Upon his reforging he seemed
taciturn and grim, becoming
ever more laconic. His valour,
however, was undimmed. At
the battle of the Mercurial
Gate in Chamon, he charged
in fearlessly to fight Archaon
himself. Thostos fell, and was
devoured by Archaon’s
steed
Dorghar,
trapped forever as
a corpse in the belly of that
eldritch daemonic beast.

Though that brotherhood of
Celestial Vindicators has a new
Lord-Celestant in the form
of the strong-limbed Ortus
Drakehewer, Thostos’ chamber,
known as the Bladestorm, is
treated with caution even by its
allies. When the ki l ling wrath
is upon them, there is little
that can stop their rampage.
There are rumours that they
have spurned the orders of city
councils that have sought their
aid, going their own way in
search of revenge and stranding
their allies. Some even whisper
that the Bladestorm make little
distinction between those who
stand before them and those
who stand beside them when
the battle rage waxes high. It
is said that to witness their
hurricane of blades is to risk
feeling the deadly kiss of steel a
dozen times over.

Gerron Brokenfist’s
head cleared, the
rage ebbing away.
His lungs heaved w ith
exer tion, sucking in great
draughts of ice-cool air.
Blood drooled from his
longblades. Ahead, there
was nothing unusual on
the Ghyrrano Tundra
other than scorched
w ildgrass. He turned,
confused for a moment.
Stretching behind
him was a trail of
dismembered body
par ts, broken blades
and shattered armour.
Beyond was a caravan
of bow-backed wagons,
rhinoxen snor ting and
stomping impatiently.
Gerron could just make
out children peering
from the tanned leather
canopies of the wagons,
faces pale in the wan
light. As Gerron trudged
back, they disappeared
like mice bolting for
their holes.
The corpse-trail was
fresh; blood spur ted from
the torn-open cadavers
and strewn limbs. Most of
those hacked to ribbons
bore the taint of Chaos
mutation – mottled skin,
tentacles,
jaundiced eyes.
Some of the fallen wore
the tanned armour of the
Nomad Guard.
Questions filled
Gerron’s mind. Had his
fellow Stormcasts died in
the battle, and returned
to Azyr? Or had he
always been alone? He
knew he had to protect
the caravan, but who
were these people, and
where were they going?
A miasma of doubt
overwhelmed him. Had it
been his own blades that
had brought death to the
Nomad Guard?
And,
in the final
reckoning, did it
really matter?

Anvils of the
Heldenhammer

ANVILS OF THE HELDENHAMMER

The Ancients, Sepulchral Sons, They Who Claim Death

The Anvils of the Heldenhammer are the dark and brooding heroes of an old era, reforged as the
Broken World span sinister beneath a fell aspect. They have come to embrace the death they once
feared, and fight like the spectral knights from some ominous legend.

The warriors of this black-
clad Stormhost have all the
advantages that age and
experience brings – but few,
if
any, of the drawbacks. Shorn
of the weaknesses of mortal
clay,
the wisdom brought
to them by their long span
of consciousness is only a
blessing. Each of the Anvils
of the Heldenhammer hails
from a time lost to the mists
of memory – they were not
rescued from the threshold of
death fighting against Chaos,
but were already long slain at
the time they were plucked
from the Mortal Realms and
taken up to Azyr. They have
learned well of the afterlife,
and what it is to be a ghostly
presence in the Shyishan
underworlds. The Anvils
preserve the battle rites and
practices of olden times, and
are all the more potent for it,
for they blend the knowledge
of the ancients with the vitality
and strength of the new.

All of the Anvils dwelt as
shades in Shyish for centuries
before being taken into
Sigmar’s armies. They typically
have an archaic mode of
speech, a habit of harking
back to mythical warriors
like they were old friends,
and of recalling legendary
victories as if they happened
only yesterday. Taken from
the length and breadth of the
Shyishan underworlds, all
Anvils of the Heldenhammer
have a cold inner strength that
enabled their spirits to endure
the passage of the centuries
with their anima intact. Their
lineages have continued
without them, their sons
siring children in their turn
whenever they find a haven
from the scourge of Chaos.

There have been times in the
history of the free cities when
a sombre warrior from this
Stormhost has fought shoulder-
to-shoulder with a distant
descendant of his familial
line,
a haunting sense of familiarity
the only clue that one is the
forefather of the other. Such
occurrences are most frequent
in and around Anvilgard –
the stronghold founded in
recognition of the Anvils’
role in the emancipation of
the Brimstone Peninsula
– and in Stygxx, where the
Anvils’
foremost Stormkeep is
reflected in the black waters of
Lake Lethis.

At the dawn of the Realmgate
Wars,
the Anvils of the
Heldenhammer had more
questions concerning their
true nature than any other
Stormhost. Their quiet and
contemplative immortality
as spirits in Shyish had been
replaced by a vicious, hard-
fought cycle of life, death and
rebirth fueled by the celestial
energies of Azyr. They had
not asked for such a fate, and
though most were only too
pleased to make the most of
this second chance to stand
and fight, there were those that
questioned Sigmar’s right to
remake them without giving
them a choice.

In creating the Anvils, the
God-King had angered
Nagash beyond the point of
sane recompense – the Great
Necromancer claims all the
spirits in Shyish, be they
undead or merely shades of the
past, as his rightful subjects.
When first forged, the warriors
of the Anvils feared that, upon
their death, they would once
again fall into the clutches of

Nagash, and would pay the
price a thousand times over
for Sigmar’s theft, their spirits
twisted in the most terrible
punishments Nagash could
devise, for the rest of time.
Much to the relief of the Anvils,
that fear was revealed to be
unfounded over the course of
the Realmgate Wars. When
the Anvils died, they did
not fall into Nagash’s
claws
as they dreaded, but were
instead drawn back to the
Sigmarabulum to be reborn.
This remained true no matter
how many times they met their
end in battle.

This realisation caused a
radical change in attitude.
Released from the spectre of
eternal torture, they came
instead to see death as a
weapon, an ally, and even a
refuge. Slowly, as the teachings
of the Black Sepulchres evolved
from a treatise on allaying the
raw power of death to a study
of using those same macabre
energies as weapons, the Anvils
began to truly appreciate the
gift of death – even to revere
it. They came into their role
as guardians of the afterlife,
welcoming every chance to
return to Shyish and break the
shackles of the tyrants and
overlords that sought to enslave
it. Morbid cults and catacomb-
lodges gained influence in the
Anvils’ culture, many revering
an ancestor figure known as
Morrda, the Pale Rider, Master
of the Bleak Raven. In the
legends of Shyish, that ancient
god defied Nagash and yet
remained whole, and the Anvils
seek to do the same.

However,
just as with any
other Stormhost, the Anvils
must pay a price for their

‘O pen it,’
commanded Holme van Lauhann,
gesturing at the lichgate of the Lethis Mausoleum.
‘We have corpses to claim.’
His skeleton bodyguard tramped forwards in unison,
fleshless hands grasping the gate and heaving it off its hinges
before letting it topple away with a clang. Van Lauhann
waited for his minions to go through first – one did not
become a High Necromancer without knowing the value of
caution – then strode inside.
One by one, the figures that van Lauhann had taken to be
shadowed statues by the side of the path came to life, striding
out to bar his path. He cursed himself for a fool. The way was
blocked with shields of onyx sigmarite, and the figures wore
death’s head masks and w ielded warhammers that trailed
purple mist.
‘How dreary,’
said van Lauhann, waving a pallid claw at
his skeletons.
‘Cut these soul-stealing trespassers down.’
The skeletons screeched and dar ted forward, driven on a
wave of deathly magic, but even with the frantic energy of
the animated dead they could not batter their way past the
shield-wall. Too late, van Lauhann saw more statuesque
figures emerging from behind the tombs, through the gate
he had entered, and even rising from the graves themselves.
Amethyst sparks crackled from the ground, growing into arcs
of lightning,
that then became black-armoured giants with
elaborate helms. Hammers swung, fists punched, armoured
feet stamped, and within half a minute van Lauhann’s
bodyguard was no more. A hear tbeat later and he was
completely surrounded.
‘It matters little,’
sneered the Necromancer as a helmed
onyx statue came to stand before him, the dust of shattered
bone discolouring his armour.
‘We will rise again. Even
your kind cannot escape the power of Nagash.’
‘So thy w ish is to master death itself,
little
weakling? ’ said the Stormcast Eternal in a
whispering rasp. It slid a broad dagger from its
scabbard. Van Lauhann brought up his staff, but
it was too late; the dagger’s tip was already at
his throat. The Necromancer watched as the
impassive black mask loomed in close, and
heard the figure’s words rustling like dried leaves
in his ears.
‘Then thou shalt star t at the beginning.’
The dagger bit deep, and van Lauhann knew
no more.

triumph over mortality. Those
that have been reforged too
many times develop a deathly
aspect, and are often unable
to speak above a whisper.
Under their impassive masks
their flesh is corpse-pale
and drawn. They have much
experience in turning their fell
appearance and chill mien to
their advantage – even using it
to gain audience amongst the
darker courts of the Realm of
Death. This gives them a fell
reputation in parts of Shyish,
but the Anvils are long beyond
proving themselves, and care
little for the chattering of the
mortal folk they have come to
see as children.

A more sinister fate even than
the flaw caused by reforging
threatens the Anvils of the
Heldenhammer. Nagash
would shatter the realms to
reclaim their souls, for the
Great Necromancer sees them
as his undeniable property.
Even should it take millennia
to achieve it, Nagash plans to
make the Anvils his unliving
servants for all eternity. Only
now, after the coming of the
realm-shaking apocalypse that
was the Shyish necroquake, has
Nagash shown that he has the
power to capture a Stormcast
soul and drag it in chains to
his oubliettes.

From the candelabra-lit
chambers of the Black
Sepulchres, Lord-Relictors
brood long on the subject of
how best to escape that deathly
destiny. They create weapons
that can capture errant souls,
and journey to the darkest of
hells to claim vital knowledge
on Sigmar’s behalf. They
work with their Stormhost’s
extensive and learned
Sacrosanct Chambers to delve
deep into the far reaches
of Shyish,
in the hope of
unearthing the secrets of true
immortality. Though they risk
their souls in doing so, they
know the cost to the Stormcast
Eternals wi l l be severe indeed
should they fail.

an unbroken chain of gleaming
white armour and blue shields.
Their martial philosophy
emphasises the regiment over
the individual, and it is said
by those that witness them in
battle that they fight as one. It
is not their extensive training

in the Gladitorium that binds
them so tightly, but the tenets
of the Shining Lord, the first
and most unwavering of
their number. This ethos is so
extreme it breeds tight bonds of
loyalty – and lethal warriors.

The Knights Excelsior have a
great many Paladins in their
number, with Retributors
the most common retinues
amongst them – the ability
to blast an enemy to ash with
one sweep of a grandhammer
is valued highly by those
that would see their enemies
literally scattered to the winds.
From the Consecralium, their
primary Stormkeep in Excelsis,
they march out each day to
bring annihilation to the forces
of Chaos, leaving only tumbled
ruins, blackened grass and
awed rumours of lightning-
wreathed angels in their wake.

Cables of chain lightning descend in great helical spirals to strike with thunderous force as the
white-armoured warriors emerge at fu l l charge. When the storm of their attack passes it leaves
only smouldering ruin, for the Knights Excelsior are obliteration given form.
‘N early there,’
said
Trademaster
Jahns, smiling at
his w ife. ‘When we reach
New Haven we will be free
of raiders, and very, very
rich indeed.’
‘Jahns!’ shouted Wrynn
from the top of the steam-
crawler.
‘You have to
see this!’
Jahns climbed over the
crates of wyrdroot tobacco
to peer out of the cupola.
Where the foundling
city of New Haven should
have stood, banners
fluttering atop its crucible
spires, there was only a
vast crater of scorched
ear th. With trembling
hands, Jahns focused his
scryer-scope. There were
tall white figures there,
putting the last of the
unburned rubble to the
torch. They stood with the
bearing of kings, capes
billowing and lightning
icons emblazoned on
their shoulders.
‘Turn back!’ shouted
Jahns, waving at the
driver’s segment.
One of the figures
was looking right at
him, eyes glowing in its
expressionless mask.
Jahns felt his stomach
clench as he heard a
harsh command. A line of
figures armed with bows
took formation on the lip
of the crater. Chains of
energy crackled around
their bolts as they nocked
and drew.
The wheels of the crawler
screeched as it turned, but
Jahns knew it was already
too late.

Celestial
Warbringers

CELESTIAL WARBRINGERS

The Seers of War, Masters of Portent,

the Mystical Eye

The Celestial Warbringers are a force like no other in Sigmar’s Stormhosts, for they have the
ability to foresee the manner of their own deaths. Such god-given foresight makes for brave
warriors and gifted seers, and their might at arms is matched by their prowess in storm magic.

For the battle seers of the
Celestial Warbringers,
there is
no greater joy than righteous
conflict. This Stormhost is
tight-knit, for each of its
number hails from the same
mystical tribe – a clan of
bold warriors who claim to
have foresight of their own
unique doom.

Laughing as they plunge into
battle, the fearlessness and
audacity of the Warbringers
has persisted even after their
reforging. Though they can be
dismissive of outsiders, their
bonds of brotherhood make
them lively companions at
a feast. To a man who truly
believes his final death wi l l
come another day, no foe is
too daunting.

The Celestial Warbringers
were the first Stormhost of the
Second Striking to be founded.
They have more Sacrosanct
Chambers than most of
Sigmar’s Stormhosts, for they
seek to make the most use of
the celestial portents. At the
command of their spiritual
leader, the grand seer known
as the Golden Patriarch, their
Lord-Ordinators garrison a
great many Warscryer Citadels
across the lands. Of late, this
Stormhost has sought not only
to scry its own fate, but that
of entire nations, the better
to save them from the twin
scourges of Chaos and Death.
The Celestial Warbringers are
sometimes known as Sigmar’s
Spear – named for the blinding
lightning that carries them
to war, and is said to presage
each strike. Those of weak wi l l
who see these streaks of light
are already half-beaten by fear
when the Celestial Warbringers
launch their assault.

‘But

‘A re you not afraid of them? They eat you, at the end.
And Jethru said they sometimes do it when you are
still alive,’
the young warrior said, voice trembling.
Hathron Vitalis laughed loud.
‘No, I’m not afeared of these.
Besides, if they try to eat me, they will get a nasty shock!’ He
made an ascending zig-zag with his finger, pointing to the
storm clouds above.
‘I will not die this day.’
To his relief, the boy gave a small smile, before asking,
how can you know? ’
Vitalis shrugged jovially.
‘I saw it in the skies. I will meet
my final death at the claws of a gheist, and he will not let
me go.’ He waggled his fingers in a mock-scare gesture and
grimaced, eyes w ide. ‘But today we face the bloody ones! So
for me, there is nothing to fear. And I’ ll let you into a secret.’
The boy frowned, his confusion mingling with hope.
‘You will not die today either. I shall make sure of it, even if
it’s the last thing I do. Which it won’t be!’
The boy laughed nervously, and stood a little taller.
‘Now then, master bladesman,’
said Vitalis, putting a
massive hand on the boy’s bony shoulder.
‘Let us sound the
horns of war, stand back-to-back, and show these ravening
dogs what it is to cross the mighty sons of Sigmar.’
The boy nodded, eyes gleaming. Together they walked
out of the por tcullis, but only Vitalis knew neither of them
would return.

Tempest Lords

TEMPEST LORDS

The Host on High,

the Blue-Blooded, the Rulers Above

The thunderclouds above fill with flickers of azure light. The skies boom, and from on high comes
a winged host of shining lords as twelve mighty bolts of lightning shoot down to bring their
earthbound comrades. To look upon the Tempest Lords is to know true majesty.
‘L ord Tempest,’
called up the leader of the Neosian
Pine-prophets.
‘We are ready to go to Sigmar’s side.’
The man’s
tobacco-breath was so foul that Dontrian
Cyrocco could smell it from a spear’s leng th away. Behind the
flagellant a ragged crowd of his fellows nodded in agreement,
some emaciated and as sombre as judges, others heavily
muscled and w ild-eyed, their hairy manes spiked with pig fat.
Their Hessian rags were shabby in contrast to the gleaming,
midnight plate of the Stormhost’s Angelos Conclave. But
Dontrian had seen them fight, and knew them to be as bold
as any Stormcast.
‘This day we shall charge together!’ said Dontrian.
‘But not
to the fore. You will double back and take the river, walking
its leng th along the gully to fall on the foe from behind. As
you do so, we will strike from the clouds. To attack from all
sides is to secure victory, as Sigmar taught us, even against a
foe as fierce as these gluttonous ogors.’ Besides, he thought,
for this lot a dip in the river could only be a good thing.
‘As you say, Lord Tempest,’
said the hedge prophet, making
the sign of the tw in-tailed comet.
‘Will you take your twelve-
tally this time, Lord Tempest? ’
Dontrian cocked his head.
‘Perhaps,’ he said.
‘If I can
convince Sigmar these gut-wobblers are so fat that each one
counts as three.’ Dontrian smiled conspiratorially, and half
of the Devoted smiled with him. Good enough, he thought.
Perhaps some of them would survive the day after all.
‘Good hunting,’ he cried out as he donned his helm,
spreading his wings of light and shooting up into the air,
see you at the feast!’

The Tempest Lords are noble
and courteous without
exception. Each hails from a
Hyshian dynasty of warrior
aristocrats that reveres not only
Sigmar, but the teachings of
the armoured high priestess
known as Mirmidh, She Who
Rules. Where the Hammers of
Sigmar are expert tacticians,
the Tempest Lords have a gift
for grand strategies, and work
at plans that span decades for
the betterment of all. They see
it as their duty to protect the
less fortunate, not with edicts,
but with hammer and shield.
The Tempest Lords were once
told by Sigmar himself that
each is equal to a dozen mortal
warriors – and they took it
literally. They lead by example,
their numerous Angelos
Conclaves winging down
to reap a twelve-tally before
fighting onward. Their stirring
rhetoric has a galvanising effect
on mortal men; inspired by
their words, the downtrodden
rise up to follow the Tempest
Lords to glory.

Astral Templars

ASTRAL TEMPLARS

The Beast-Slayers, Heavens’ Claw,

the Bane of Tyrants

55

Recruited from the most
warlike and barbarous mortal
tribes, the Stormcast Eternals
of the Astral Templars are
warriors born. They were
once savages, uncouth but
true of heart, and are hence
never more at home than
when surrounded by enemies
in battle. This fierce heritage
has stood them in good stead.
Four Warrior Chambers of
the Astral Templars famously
entered the Gnarlwood of
Ghur to hunt the monsters
there – and not only survived,
but emerged from the
darkness victorious.

Called barbaric by some, the Astral Templars have lost none of their tribal savagery in the process
of reforging. Their specialism lies in the slaying of monstrous foes, for as mortals they hunted
giant beasts to survive. Now they fight gargants and hulking tyrants on behalf of all the realms.
‘T hat one’s mine!’ Balarus Kingskinner barged
through the nomads of the caravan towards the
looming wyvern-thing that was decimating its
horsemen. One of the attacking orruks swung its double-
handed cleaver low as he threaded through the melee.
Balarus vaulted over the blade as if he was wearing no
more than the loincloth of his former life, and landed with
a crunch on a sneaking grot scavenger. He nearly lost his
footing, bouncing hard off another orruk’s back before
sprinting away. No time to tarry. He had thicker necks
to slash.
‘Out of the damn way!’ shouted Balarus, slamming through
a thin line of mud-smeared pikemen towards his quarry.
The giant scaled beast bit the head off a warhorse, hurling
the bloody remains into a phalanx of Liberators even as its
orruk rider took the head from a Fulminator. Balarus heard
the whinny of horses as a hurtling wagon careened into a
ditch nearby. He ducked behind its thick wooden slats as
crude orruk arrows shot overhead, then jumped aboard the
coach plate and eyed the creature he had come to kill.
The stallions thrashed, w ild-eyed, as the monstrous orruk
warbeast spread its tattered wings. Balarus tensed and leapt,
spear raised high. Sun glinted on his gore-spattered
plate as he came down to embed his spear deep
in the monster’s spine, just as his father had
taught him. He hung on for grim life with
one hand, as the roaring beast flapped into
the skies. The orruk warlord atop the creature
turned with a rattle of chains, battle-lust
glowing in its red eyes.
Balarus grinned. This was what he had
been made to do, and it felt fine.

Their commanders are the
most ferocious of their kind,
and they take great pleasure
in hurling themselves into
desperate combats and
matching themselves against
towering, Chaos-tainted
monsters. Of especial skill are
the warriors of the Vanguard
Chambers, who have highly
developed hunter’s
instincts.

The Astral Templars still
wear furs and pelts over their
sigmarite armour, mementos
of their feral past. In their
tribal rituals, the Stormhost
honours Ursricht, the White
Bear. Though commonly
depicted as a white-haired
man, it is said he is a godbeast
that can take the form of a
gigantic ursine monster when
the season of war is at hand.
It is his ferocious brawn that
the Astral Templars seek
to emulate. When the skies
rumble like the growl of a
hunting beast, and the clouds
yawn open to disgorge thick
columns of lightning, even the
largest Chaos-drake or vilest
gargant can soon find itself not
predator, but prey.

Weaponry of the
Stormhosts

WEAPONRY OF THE STORMHOSTS

The hammers and blades of the Stormcast Eternals are crafted in the living tempests of the
Celestial Realm. Each weapon is forged from the magical metal sigmarite, and then infused with
the energies of the sentient storms of Azyr to lend them a core of celestial power.

When Sigmar created his Stormhosts, he went
to great lengths to create weapons and armour
that would be worthy of them. They are without
exception made from sigmarite, and hence they
are able to transubstantiate into celestial energy
when their wielder is slain so they may return
to Azyr with the elemental force of his soul.
Forged in heavenly storms, the weapons retain
the aspect of the specific tempest bound to them,
even when hammered into their final shape. For
example, the Azheden Thunderhead is blunt and
pitiless, and hence makes good warhammers,
while the Ayorrian Maelstrom is quick and
restless and so makes excellent skybolts.

Every weapon created for Sigmar’s warriors
is a potent artefact infused with lightning.
Transformed from the very stuff of Azyr into
hard metallic form, they are forged not unlike
the Stormcast Eternals themselves, with all
weakness purged from their construction.
Therein is founded a kinship between warrior
and weapon. These blades, axes and hammers
resonate with the power of Sigmar, becoming far
deadlier than they ever could in the hands of a
mortal soldier.

The shields borne by the Stormcast Eternals
bear stylised icons. All the Stormhosts of the


PAGEBREAK
57

First Striking – those that Sigmar and the Six
Smiths created first – bear the icon of the sacred
hammer. This represents both the Stormcast
Eternals themselves, and also Ghal Maraz, the
Great Shatterer.

Scions of the god Grungni, the duardin
demigods known as the Six Smiths oversee the
great storm-factories and temple-smiths of the
Sigmarabulum. Scorch-skinned artisans craft
the weapons of thunder and lightning that the
Stormcasts use to bring summar y justice to the
God-King’s enemies.

The gilded halls of Sigmar’s realm constantly
echo to the ring of hammers and the hiss of
hot metal quenched in pools of quicksilver. The
greatest of these weapons are further enchanted
by the blessings of the God-King’s mystical

artisans,
imbued with celestial energy over the
course of sacred cycles. These lightning-blessed
relics are often given to the greatest heroes of
the Stormhosts, such as the Lord-Celestants,
Lord-Relictors and Primes. Forever alive with
crackling cords of energy, a blow from such a
weapon can devastate even a fully armoured
Chaos warrior, smashing him into a ruined heap
of smoking flesh and blackened steel.

Each of the weapons borne by the Stormhosts
is a masterpiece of the blacksmith’s
art. They
include hammers of prodigious size, blades so
keen they can carve apart stone-skinned beasts,
and arrows so charged with celestial power they
can incinerate those they strike true. These are
the weapons of the Stormhosts’ champions, as
vital to their missions of conquest as the strength
Sigmar forged into their statuesque physiques.

THE CELESTANT-PRIME

The Celestant-
Prime

The Celestant-Prime is the very embodiment of the Storm of Sigmar. Those who meet the Celestant-Prime in
battle face the fu l l brunt of the God-King’s wrath, for he is the Avenging Angel of Azyr, the Bearer of the World-
Hammer, and the First Scion of Sigmar.

When Sigmar first reforged a mortal
into a Stormcast Eternal, he laboured
long and hard at the arcane process.
Many were the mysteries employed
in the creation of this warrior, one
who was to be an answer to the
greatest champions of Chaos. When
this great work was completed,
however, Sigmar’s creation would
not rise. He simply lay inert, as if
in slumber.

Sigmar was not deterred, as he
understood that even the greatest
warrior was incomplete without
the appropriate weapon. So it was
that, when Sigmar’s Tempest broke,
he sent his warriors to find and
retrieve his own hammer, Ghal
Maraz,
lost in the Age of Myth. The
quest was difficult, and costly for
those who fought the lords of Chaos
guarding the resting place of the
great warhammer. Nonetheless,
it
was returned to the God-King, and
the Heavens thundered in approval.
When Sigmar bore the weapon to the
Forbidden Vault and placed it in the
hand of his creation, the warrior’s
eyes opened, and he rose on blazing
wings to meet his destiny.

From the Celestant-Prime’s first
strike into the realms, those Chaos
warlords that matched themselves
against him have been found
wanting. Torglug the Despised,
Gerhart the Unshriven and Salacia
Everseeking were all blessed with
great power by their gods. All met
their end upon the blunt face of the
warhammer Ghal Maraz – or felt the
crushing impact of the Cometstrike
Sceptre, a weapon imbued with so
much celestial power it can pull
meteors from the firmament and
send them crashing into the enemy.
Around the Celestant-Prime swirl
the energies of his creation. These
gifts from Sigmar form a mystical
orrery that lends him insight into
what lies ahead.

Though he is a figurehead to the
Hammers of Sigmar more than any
other Stormhost, the Celestant-
Prime’s armour wi l l manifest the
livery of whatever warriors he
aids. Around him the Stormcasts
fight all the harder,
for they know
that Sigmar has sent his mightiest
champion to help them accomplish
their mission.

The warhammer Ghal Maraz is
an icon of divine might as much
as a weapon, yet its purpose is not
to sit idle. Sigmar has entrusted
it to the Celestant-Prime as a
tool of deliverance as much as of
domination. Struck with runes of
justice, the hammer is a bane to
Chaos, and only the most powerful
of the Dark Gods’ minions can bear
to look upon its radiance. Trailing
twin comet-tails of celestial energy
when swung with sufficient force,
the hammer can blast an evil man to
scattering ash.

Yet
its powers are not merely
destructive. At the battle of the
Blackstone Summit, the Celestant-
Prime struck the warlord Torglug
the Despised with a blow that slew
his plague-riddled body, but sent his
soul – or at least the part of it that
was still noble – winging to High
Azyr to be reforged. So was Tornus
the Redeemed given life. Since that
day, the Celestant-Prime has freed
many others from the yoke of Chaos,
and a new breed of warrior has been
introduced into the glorious armies
of the Heavens.

A ggarac the Bladefiend grinned so wide he
felt his face would split. Every one of the
Bloodbound knew by now that the storm
warriors were worthy adversaries. All he wanted was a
hard fight, but until the assault on the people of Crown
Citadel, he had never faced them. Yet now, with their
precious Sigmar-worshipping cattle threatened, they
had blazed down from the skies by the hundred. On
the shattered peak below, where the rock formed a
natural causeway to the for tress wall, a small group of
shield-armed Stormcasts were being battered by the
frenzied assaults of the Axenhounds. Aggarac hefted
his tooth-ridged greataxe and charged, kicking aside
his followers to sink the weapon’s
teeth through plate
armour and into Stormcast flesh. It was a credit to the
defenders’ stamina that they had held out so long, but
as Aggarac waded in, screaming and hacking, they
finally buckled and broke.
One of the Stormcast Eternals cried out, imploring
the skies above for salvation. Aggarac smiled, a wild
hyena’s
laugh bubbling up from his chest. It died on

his lips as a blazing figure descended from the clouds,
tw ice the size of a mor tal man and with a nimbus of
magical light shining around its wings. In its hands
was a weapon so holy Aggarac could not even look
upon it. The defenders of the Citadel cried out, joyous
and proud at their deliverance.
Suddenly the numinous figure was amongst his
warriors, sweeps of its sceptre and hammer flinging
hardened Bloodbound lords from the ridge as if they
were no more than scorched meat and shattered bone.
Aggarac gripped his axe, climbed a spire of rock, and
roared a wordless challenge. The figure turned, empty
sockets suddenly alight with cerulean energy.
‘Aggarac of Verantai,’
it said, pointing its sceptre.
‘You were not always this way. If there is a seed of the
man you once were left inside that tainted shell, I can
bring you salvation.’
Aggarac spat hard at the thing, the gobbet of bloody
phlegm crackling to nothing.
‘If not,’
it said, raising that godly hammer,
and be damned.’

LORD-CELESTANTS

Just as Sigmar once led the Pantheon of Order, so does the burden of command now fall upon his Lord-Celestants.
Storied warlords and warriors all, even before their apotheosis into one of Sigmar’s Stormcast Eternals, those that
the God-King chooses to lead his mightiest hosts in war are without peer.

Lord-Celestants

Lord-Celestants are born leaders
– the raging centre of each storm-
strike. Thundering commands,
it
is they who lead entire chambers
of Stormcast Eternals into the fray
and direct them in battle, their
unrelenting fur y and unwavering
dedication inspiring those around
them. Sigmar does not idly bestow
the title of Lord-Celestant,
for
into these foremost champions he
imbues the greatest portions of his
godly power. They are not measured
by combat skills alone, though
their record in the Gladitorium

speaks volumes. To claim such
a revered position, a prospective
Lord-Celestant must complete a
challenge assigned to him by the
God-King himself.

These final trials are unique to each
aspirant,
for nothing is hidden from
the sight of he who remade them.
In these trials an aspiring Lord-
Celestant must meditate, alone, as he
journeys to the dark of his soul and
confronts his innermost fear – be
that as tangible a foe as a ravening
behemoth that once fed on his people

when he was young, or as abstract an
adversary as a sense of inescapable
doom. Should the aspirant emerge
having overcome his personal terror,
he wi l l have proven his right, beyond
any doubt, to lead a chamber of
Stormcast Eternals.

In theory,
it is the role of the
Lord-Celestants to remain cool
and level-headed no matter the
extremity of the situation into
which Sigmar has hurled them. In
practice, they too can be caught up
in the frantic turmoil of war,
for
they are all fighters and crusaders
at heart. They hew and smite their
foes with finely wrought runic
blades or brutal warhammers, all
the while commanding the warriors
at their disposal with the skill of
a master tactician. The style of
war each Lord-Celestant employs
is ultimately up to him, but
whether he strides at the heart of an
infantr y advance or rides atop a loyal
Stardrake, wherever he fights, the
enemy is surely doomed.

Those Lord-Celestants
that take to the fight
on foot, such as
Lord Gardus of the
Hallowed Knights,
are especially
beloved of those they
command. Not for
them the grandeur of
a mythical steed that
bears them away to glory.
These leaders of men wi l l march,
trudge, climb, fight and die without
hesitation alongside the most new-
forged Liberator or lowly Devoted
mendicant – for they know that
by suffering alongside those they
command, they win more in the way
of loyalty and respect than if they
impart their orders from afar. When
such champions call out to their
warriors to enact vengeance for their
fallen kin, a great cry goes up, and
the furious storm of retribution that
rains upon the enemy can break a
battle-line in a matter of moments.

61

Those Lord-Celestants that take to
the field upon Dracoths usually do so
to lead the charge of a cavalr y wing,
such as the echelons of the Extremis
Chambers, or a celestial hunting
pack of mounted troops. Such forces
are consummate line-breakers,
smashing through armoured hordes
of Blood Warriors or even brutish
ogors. They have even matched
their blades against the riders of
the Varanguard, Archaon’s
chosen
elite, and emerged triumphant.
Dracoth riders who lead forces of
infantr y – such as the ever-confident
Lucaros Proudblade of the Lions of
Sigmar – ride tall in the saddle, their
commanding presence inspiring
those around them so that the idea of
defeat is banished.

Lord-Celestants who ride to war on
the backs of the great beasts known
as Stardrakes are undeniably the
most impressive of their kind. All
eyes turn to them as they descend
from on high in a blur of aetheric
essence, the immensity of their
scaled steeds giving them the
bearing of demigods. From their
ornate saddles these lords call
out challenges to the enemies of
Sigmar. Their grandeur is such that
many adversaries have refused to
take up the gauntlet, and appeared
like weak and cowardly worms in
comparison – thus losing the respect
of those they seek to command,
and sundering the strength of their
warhost without even a single blow
being dealt. These Lord-Celestants
have an aura of command so
powerful that even the children
of Dracothion acknowledge them
as lord and master, fighting all the
harder in their presence.

All Lord-Celestants are figures of
awe and fear. To the people of the
realms, they are champions sent
from the Heavens, so redolent with
Sigmar’s holy strength they have
little to nothing in common with
the people they save from the claws
of Chaos. To the enemies of Sigmar,
they are inescapable vengeance made
flesh – implacable, unknowable,
and as hard as tempered steel. If
the daemon hordes of the Dark
Gods know anything as human as
fear,
it is embodied in the form of
the Lord-Celestant.

With Sigmar’s hosts fighting the
length and breadth of the Realms,
there are already many Lord-
Celestants who have made a name
for themselves – both within the
Stormhosts and without. Lord
Illuminos of the Gleaming Spears,
known to many as the Saviour of
Thraesh, duelled a dozen champions
of the Brazen Host one-by-one
outside the gates of that besieged
city. Though he died at the last, he
had kept the eyes of that conquering
horde upon him, buying time for
the city’s Scourge Privateers to
arrive in the docks and launch a
crushing flank attack from the sand
dunes nearby.

Lord Victrian Cyrocco of the
Tempest Lords played a pivotal
role in the freeing of the Ashlands
of Aqshy. He is the first to admit
he has a certain pride, though it
is tempered by the humility of the
truly noble. Victrian is a generous
leader – he bequeathed the Cyroccan
Dynasty’s traditional heirloom – the
kingsblade – to his squire Xedurio
long ago in favour of the long-hafted
hammer of his household. He is
skilled indeed in combat, but in
recent years has focused on the role
of strategist rather than champion.
Ever a great statesman, Victrian
is an orator fluent in a score of
mortal languages, and the tapestry
of martial diplomacy with which
he has bound the new cities of the
Great Parch may yet prove his most
abiding contribution to the rise of
Sigmar’s new order.

Brutos Gargantson of the Astral
Templars is as hair y and bad-
tempered as Ursricht, the White
Bear himself, but when he has
a greataxe in his hand he is as
deadly a warrior as any in Sigmar’s
Stormhosts. At battle’s end, when he
leads his Warrior Chamber back to
the Valorhall on the outskirts of the
Gnarlwood, Lord Brutos personally
nails the trophy of his new victory to
the shield-covered walls of the feast
hall – be it a severed Mutalith head, a
Shaggoth’s greataxe or the crown of a
slain tyrant. He slumps in his throne,
scowling as his men celebrate, for he
is only happy in the wild frenzy of
melee. But with the Chaos threat still
looming, he is never idle for long.

L ord-Celestant Orrin
Truestrike knelt upon
the altar directly beneath
the zenith of his Extremis
Chamber’s Drakesworn Temple,
a single shaft of starlight
throwing the features of his
war-mask into stark relief. The
tip of his blade sank a finger’s
breadth into the ursidont
ivory sur face of the altar. Over
the cycles, as the ritual was
repeated, that depth would
become a hand’s span. But this
time was the first.
The chamber’s Dracothian
Guard were arranged in a wide
circle around the foot of the
altar. The almost inaudible
bass rumble emanating from
the throats of their mounts
reverberated around the Hall
of Aeons,
lending the rite
an otherworldly,
trance-like
quality. Behind the Dracoth
riders, forming a larger
triangle, were the chamber’s
three Templars upon their
Stardrakes. Garidor, mightiest
of their number and steed of
Lord-Celestant Truestrike,
occupied a place of honour at
the far side of the ritual space.
The gaze of each, both
Chosen of Sigmar and Child of
Dracothion, was fixed straight
ahead. An observer would have
been forgiven for believ ing
that the ceremony was one of
mourning, that the burnished
giants who stared into no-space
were lost in a world of tragic
half-memories. Then, as if
struck by a bolt of inspiration,
Lord Orrin rose to his feet,
lifting his sword so that its
blade was bathed in the column
of light.
‘Era Draconis!’ he bellowed.
‘Era Draconis!’ the Stormcasts
echoed in unison.
The Children of Dracothion

the Stardrakes unfurled their
mighty wings with a boom

LORD-ARCANUMS

Lord-Arcanums

Masters of aetheric lightning who can manipulate the cerulean energy of Azyr, the leaders of the Sacrosanct
Chambers are known as Lord-Arcanums. Their storm-sight allows them to see the souls of living creatures, and
they can hurl destructive bolts and empower the warriors around them with but a whispered phrase of power.

Those given the rank of Lord-
Arcanum by Sigmar earned it by
wielding eldritch energies in the
name of freedom. These brave
magic-users risked body and soul as
mortals to defy the Dark Gods, and
upon their reforging find themselves
in command of even greater powers.

With the potency of Azyr coursing
through him, a Lord-Arcanum
can summon lightning as easily
as another man draws breath. In
battle, he reaches up into the skies,
a corona of corposant playing
around his staff, before pulling
down devastating energies from
above. Much like those that bear
the Stormcasts to the realms, these
strikes thunder to earth – but instead
of bringing the hosts of Azyr,
they
bring only destruction, immolating
their targets in ground-shaking
blasts. It is thought amongst the
Sacrosanct Chambers’ ranks
that the devastating sky strikes
summoned by each Lord-Arcanum
are manifestations of the Prime
Electrids, offshoots of the Great
Bolts – those columns of lightning so
fierce that Sigmar has used them to
level castles and slay godbeasts alike.
So strong is the Lord-Arcanums’
command of storm energies that, on
the field of battle, they can capture
the souls of slain Stormcast Eternals
before they vanish into the Heavens,
restoring them to their bodies so that
they can fight once more.

The magical abilities displayed by
those of the Sacrosanct Chambers
are as impressive to the creatures of
the Celestial Realm as they are to the
Stormcasts’ mortal allies. Hence it is
common for Lord-Arcanums to ride
fierce celestial beasts to war – and
the combined might of mount and
master is potent indeed.

creatures, when a Gryph-charger
joins forces with a Lord-Arcanum
the resultant bond is strong indeed;
united in their hatred of the foe,
they fight as one. Thus joined, both
Gryph-charger and rider can surf
the aetheric winds, hurtling forth as
swift as a stormbolt to re-materialise
with talons just inches from the prey.
Should a rogue soul escape from
the Anvil of the Apotheosis and get
loose in the city-like sprawl of the
Sigmarabulum, a Lord-Arcanum
wi l l typically take to the saddle
of his Gryph-charger and hunt it
down before it can wreak too much
havoc. The Lord-Arcanums that ride
Gryph-beasts have also harnessed
the regenerative power of Sigmar’s
storm; on the battlefield, chains of
lightning cascade through his nearby
comrades, invigorating them with
the power of the storm and restoring
injured comrades to strength.

A Lord-Arcanum that rides a
Celestial Dracoline to war is
typically a bombastic and bellicose
type. It is just as well, for the
Dracoline, a beast that respects only
strength of will, would soon desert
a rider that could not win its favour
– or worse still, casually disembowel
him in a blur of claws. Dracolines
are leonine beasts that hunt the
bone-armoured pachyderms of the
Azyrite mountain ranges. They
sharpen their claws on stone rich
in celestium, for not only does
that ensure they are razor-sharp,
it charges them with electric force
that is dispersed in a great blast of
energy whenever they pounce on
their prey. A Lord-Arcanum that can
harness one of these beasts as a steed
can use celestial magic to infuse
fellow Dracoline riders, making
the creature’s
lethal leap all the
more destructive.

The wind-swift beasts known as
Gryph-chargers are especially drawn
to those who wield the lightning
of Azyr. Though it takes time to
win the loyalty of one of these

There are some Lord-Arcanums
whose mastery of the heavenly
realmsphere is such they can astrally
project themselves into the aether,
that non-space that lies between

the realms. Such travellers of the
astral pathways can sometimes form
a bond with a winged Tauralon.
Capricious by nature, the Tauralon
is a beast native to the aether that
preys upon the magic-eating void-
shoals of that strange place. Since
the building of the Sigmarabulum,
whole flocks of Tauralons have taken
to using that great crescent as their
eyrie. They chase passing meteorites
and shooting stars for sport, vying
amongst themselves to see who can
head-butt the blazing stellar debris
onto a more entertaining course
– for instance, towards an astrally
projecting soul. Should a Lord-
Arcanum escape this lethal game
with their spirit intact, they can join
in by sending the meteors right back
again – and thus win the respect of
these beasts.

The friendship between arcane
warrior and celestial creature grows
into a lasting partnership when rider
and beast join their forces in war.
The Tauralon is nimble as a hawk,
despite its great size. Though it can
deliver a meteoric ram from its
curling horns that hits hard enough
to shatter a castle wall, it prefers to
avoid direct conflict, instead winging
over its intended prey with a trail
of astral
light glittering behind it.
Where this light illuminates the
enemy, settling like stardust to
glimmer upon them, it does no
discernable harm. Only when the foe
see the arrows of Judicators and the
eldritch bolts of Sacrosanct adepts
veering straight towards them – no
matter their original course – do
they realise that the Tauralon rider
that passed them by was in truth the
harbinger of their doom.

Some Lord-Arcanums prefer not
to divide their focus between their
beloved storm-magic and the taming
of a beast, no matter how intelligent
the creature. Such individuals
choose to go to war unmounted
in order to better concentrate on
their art, and they are subsequently

63

especially adept at the manipulation
of magic. If needed, they wi l l
inspire their brethren with stirring
speeches, but typically when they
raise their voice, it is not to guide
and command the warriors around
them, for the warrior-mages of the
Sacrosanct Chamber know well
what their masters expect of them.
Instead, the Lord-Arcanums call
out mystical phrases to shape and
control the magic they harness in
the name of the God-King. Of all the
Lord-Arcanums,
it is those who fight
on foot that are most likely to make
use of the endless magic that has
spilled across the realms since the
time of the necroquake, summoning
the storm-borne discs known as Dais
Arcanums to bear them to war when
speed is of the essence – and then,
when their adversaries are close,
conjuring howling maelstroms and
comets from the sky to devastate
the enemy.

ENDLESS SPELLS

Since the age of the Arcanum Optimar,
the wizards of the realms have
been able to draw upon devastating spells – though doing so is perilous
indeed. The lords of the Sacrosanct Chamber are no exception.

Of the living spells harnessed by the Sacrosanct Chambers, three
are prevalent. The Dais Arcanum is a whirring disc of cogs; built
around the ancient wheel of magic design, it uses the same principles
as the Arcanabulums that dot the realms. It is capable of repelling a
realmsphere’s gravity, and when driven by the wi l l of a Lord-Arcanum,
can bear its caster across the lands at great speed.

A Celestian Vortex is summoned by casting two ensorcelled hammers
into the troubled skies, where they revolve around one another, slowly
at first, but gathering a deadly momentum. They multiply over and over
as the vortex gets more intense to form a maelstrom that strikes the
unworthy with skull-crushing force.

The third of this trinity of spells is the Everblaze Comet. This can be can
be pulled from its orbit to slam home into the enemy ranks in a great
explosion – but the ki l ling does not stop there. Even when earthbound
the comet releases pulses of Azyrite magic that can annihilate those
foolish enough to stand near it.

LORDS OF THE HOST

Lords of the Host

Strength of arms alone is not enough to win a war. The true excellence of the Stormcast Eternals lies in their
disciplined ranks and fearless leadership. Each champion and commander amongst them has been forged for a
specific role upon the battlefield, occupying a vital place alongside their brothers.

LORD-RELICTORS

Amongst the ranks of the
Stormhosts, the Lord-Relictors
are figures of mystery and awe.
Though all mortals chosen by the
God-King to undergo the reforging
demonstrate their martial strength
and hatred of Chaos, those selected
to become Lord-Relictors possess a
rare wisdom that sets them apart.
Whether they were atavistic shamans
or priests in their former lives, each
Lord-Relictor has demonstrated
a spiritual affinity with the magic
that permeates the Mortal Realms.
Broken and remade upon the
Anvil of the Apotheosis, and tested
within the spirit-haunted vaults of
the Temple of Ages, their powers
are twinned with the energy of the
storm itself. Just as the Liberators
wield their hammers or blades with
strength and skill, so the Lord-
Relictors harness the fulminating
magic of Azyr. At their command,
lowering storm clouds gather, and
Sigmar’s foes taste the metallic
tang of their impending judgement
before blinding bolts of lightning
arc down white-hot from the skies,
hurling smoking warriors into the
ozone-laced air.

The Lord-Relictors go to battle clad
in grim Mortis armour adorned
with the sacred bones of heroes. The
dually morbid and wondrous aspect
of the Lord-Relictors represents the
contradiction that lies at the very
heart of what it is to be a Stormcast
Eternal, for they must pass through
death in order to live again in
Sigmar’s name. It is a dichotomy
that the Lord-Relictors not only
symbolise, but embody in their
practical function. Gifted with the
spirit-sight, they are able to guard
the souls of their fellow Stormcasts,
ensuring that they return safely to
the Celestial Realm upon death. Such
is the Lord-Relictors’
insight into the
mystical energies of the Stormcasts’
corporeal forms that they are able
to heal bodily wounds with the
lightning they channel and control.

LORD-CASTELLANTS

Each of the Stormhosts maintains its
own strongholds, from the Heralds
of Casandora’s
fortress-observatory,
whose lumin-telescopes serve as
functioning cannon batteries, to
the brooding, monolithic keep of
the Sons of Mallus,
imbued with as
much subtlety as the flat hammer-
face of Ghal Maraz. The Lord-
Castellants are the ever-vigilant
wardens of these mighty edifices.
These adamant officers are by no
means beholden to remain behind
walls, however,
for each Stormcast’s
sacred task is to bring the fight to the
Chaos invader.

In battle, the Lord-Castellants stand
with their comrades, bolstering
their spirits with bellowed oaths of
steadfastness or grim jests in the
face of seemingly impossible odds.
As the enemy hordes crash against
sigmarite shield walls, the Lord-
Castellants’ halberds arc down,
thwarting would-be death blows and
cleaving the skulls of fell champions.
Even should the shields of the front
lines be breached, overwhelmed by
ravening hordes of foes, the Lord-
Castellants stand ready to bolster
their fellows. Lambent energies from
their warding lanterns play over
battered armour and open wounds,
miraculously restoring sigmarite and
celestial flesh with the magic of the
Heavens. Where the lantern’s
rays
mend Sigmar’s chosen, they prove
anathema to the followers of Chaos,
liquefying eyeballs in their sockets
and roasting mutated hides until
they fall back in agony.

Charged with the custodianship
of all Sigmar’s holdings, Lord-
Castellants are often accompanied
by Gryph-hounds. These make ideal
guard-beasts, alerting their masters
to infiltrators, saboteurs, or shape-
shifters. Many Lord-Castellants also
draw comfort from the Gryph-
hounds’ companionship;
there is
solace to be found in the creatures’
unquestioning loyalty.

LORD-VERITANTS

Recruited from those whose
antipathy towards Chaos borders
on dangerous obsession, the Lord-
Veritants are ruthless seekers and
purgators of corruption. Since the
Stormcast Eternals first arrived
in the Mortal Realms, the Lord-
Veritants have fought on the open
field to banish dark magic with
the holy light of the God-King.
Now, as civilisation begins to
grow once more, the skills of the
Lord-Veritants are needed more
than ever. In practically all of the
free cities, dangerous cults look to
sink their claws into the fabric of
society. Should a source of treason
be uncovered, the Lord-Veritants
are merciless in its eradication, so
much so that they have come to
be regarded as fearful bringers of
Sigmar’s justice. In Excelsis, for
instance, the figure known as the
White Reaper is feared by every
citizen, be he a beggar or a king.

More than once has a wrathfu l Lord-
Veritant burst unheralded into a
noble’s court, hurling recriminations
before throwing open the shutters
of their lantern. To the horror of
those within, trusted allies shriek
and recoil, exposed for the foul
agents of the Dark Gods they truly
are. Invisible daemonic entities are
exposed, along with the foul tendrils
burrowed in the minds of their
puppets and slaves. Declaring the
God-King’s judgement, the Lord-
Veritant hacks down their quarr y
with zealous fervour, splattering
terrified onlookers with their blood.

On the field of battle, the Lord-
Veritants often accompany the firing
lines of the Judicators, who share the
ability to reveal hidden sources of
corruption. Like Lord-Castellants,
Lord-Veritants are often followed
by loyal Gryph-hounds, though
they tend to favour those beasts
possessed of a more aggressive
temperament to aid them in their
Chaos-hunting duties.

LORD-AQUILORS

Riding tall on the eagle-headed
steeds known as Gryph-chargers,
Lord-Aquilors are borne on the
winds of Sigmar’s storm. They are
entrusted with a high station and
matchless autonomy,
for they lead
the Vanguard Auxi liar y Chambers,
and from the first days of the Age of
Sigmar they have waged a shadow
war in the God-King’s name. Now
– as that war escalates ever further –
they are openly bringing the fight to
his enemies, fighting alongside the
Strike Chambers as expert hunters
and the masters of ambush and
flank attack.

Proud and keen of eye, Lord-
Aquilors are reforged from fiercely
independent warriors who have
an aptitude for command. Rather
than being singled out for standing
fast in the face of overwhelming
odds, the commanders of the
Vanguard Chambers catch Sigmar’s
eye for their unfettered spirit and
keen minds. Some were already
champions of Azyr, and awake
from their reforging to find that
where they once wore the armour
of a Lord-Celestant, they now bear
that of their new station. Others
are created as Lord-Aquilors upon
their very first reforging. These
exceptional
individuals wi l l have
fought their whole mortal lives
against hopeless odds to bring
destruction to their oppressors. Only
after they had exhausted every ploy
and trick left to them, expended
every resource down to their very
lives, did Sigmar take them, reforge
them, and then reward them with
bands of immortal warriors.

Their experiences make Lord-
Aquilors experts at coordinating
guerilla campaigns to achieve by
cunning what strength of arms
might not accomplish. They are
given free rein to choose their targets
– even Sigmar does not know where
all of the Rangers of the Stormcast
are. To coordinate the actions of
the unorthodox and disparate
Rangers is itself no mean feat, but
the Lord-Aquilors are also fearsome
combatants, riding to battle on their
avian steeds, who strike as hard as
any spawn of Chaos and run with
the speed of the wind itself.

LORD-EXORCISTS

The Lord-Exorcist is a master at
channelling celestial energy to
banish daemons and gheists. Even
Nagash,
in his towering arrogance,
has been forced to take note of these
figures, for they carr y the light of
Order, and are anathema to even the
most hateful undead spectre.

Each of these dour and otherworldly
figures was a holy man in his former
life, able to perform miracles and
rites of abjuration long before
they came to the notice of Sigmar.
Through the drawing of magical
hexagrams or the wielding of spirit-
fetishes – or even through the sheer
force of their belief – they fought
the enemies of Order wherever they
were able. In the process, they caught
Sigmar’s eye. Since their reforging,
the Lord-Exorcists’ abilities have
been magnified tenfold, and they
can even abjure daemons with
their carefully intoned phrases of
power. By slamming the heel of their
ceremonial staves upon the ground,
Lord-Exorcists can send out a wave
of crackling null energy that wi l l
banish a soul from its body – and
drive it far into the wilderness.

The Lord-Exorcist also has
purview over the lost souls that are
released from their bodies upon
the battlefield – not those of the
Stormcasts themselves, but of the
enemies they face. The rod of office
carried by a Lord-Exorcist is known
as a redemption stave. Atop it is a
magical cache lined with celestium
slate. Should a Lord-Exorcist
find a soul that he believes could
potentially be saved, he wi l l open
the gates of that cache and draw the
spirit in. Once sealed inside, the soul
is judged, thin wisps of ectoplasm
rising from within. The strange
scales atop the cache then weigh the
soul to see if it is found wanting, or
if it can be rehabilitated. Should the
skull weight of the soul-scales sink
low, the soul is banished forever into
the aether. Should that weight rise,
the soul is taken back to Azyr, where
the long process of redemption
can begin. It is a sad fact that, thus
far, those souls that can truly be
redeemed have numbered less than
the total of Lord-Exorcists in all
the Stormhosts.

LORD-ORDINATORS

It is the immense intellect of the
Lord-Ordinator that brings new
innovations and stunning leaps
of logic to the Stormhosts. Each
day they find elegant solutions to
seemingly insurmountable problems,
devising complex blueprints for a
better world and ensuring they are
put into place, whatever it takes.
These souls are recruited by Sigmar
not for their skill at arms – though
they are formidable indeed when
wielding the astral hammers of their
station – but for their raw genius.

The first duty of the Lord-Ordinator
– that of arcane engineer – is an
art form as much as a science.
Overseeing the construction of
every major keep, castle and fortress,
the Lord-Ordinators plan the
sacred buildings of Sigmar’s new
civilisations from the ground up. In
conjunction with the most expert
masons of the Free Peoples, they wi l l
ensure that every design, cornerstone
and sacred mosaic is in its right
place, the better to channel the
power of the stars above. Through
careful ritual and the correct
placement of holy scripture, the
Lord-Ordinators sow the magic of
Azyr into Sigmar’s defences. Should
a person gifted with the witch-sight
look upon a building raised by a
Lord-Ordinator for long enough,
they would see traces of glittering
celestial magic outlining every lintel,
line and junction. These structures
are further bolstered by ensorcelled
ar ti l ler y pieces of sigmarite and
blessed steel. Woe betide those that
stray beneath the vigil of the Lord-
Ordinator,
for his eye is keen indeed,
and his foes wi l l
likely end their days
as mangled and blackened corpses.

The second duty – that of prophet –
is even more complex. It is for them
to set the future in motion according
to Sigmar’s will. They must scry the
stars, sift the omens and arrive at
useful truths, all the while walking
a line between visionary seer and
rational mathematician. They
are the masters of the orrery, the
cosmograph, the arcanoscope and
the divining needle, applying strict
logic and taking leaps of faith as
necessary to ensure abiding victory
for the forces of Order.

Knights of the Stormhost

66

KNIGHTS OF THE STORMHOST

The lords of the Stormhosts cannot be everywhere at once, nor can they fulfil every role that Sigmar requires of
them – for the enemies of Order are without number. As such, each chamber has a variety of proven heroes and
champions that act as specialists and support staff for the lords that command them.

KNIGHTS-HERALDOR

When the Stormcast Eternals march
to battle, the Knights-Heraldor
sound the signals of war for their
Strike Chamber. Typically heavy-
set, bombastic individuals, they
provide a point of stability in even
the most fiercely contested areas
of a battlefield – for even those
surrounded by the enemy, with their
allies out of sight, can find solace in
their clarion call. A battle-line that
is anchored by a Knight-Heraldor is
considered by many Lord-Castellants
to be a better bulwark than any
fortress wa l l.

Each Knight-Heraldor carries a
gleaming battle-horn from which
hangs a pennant emblazoned with
the icons of the Stormhosts. It is this
divine instrument that they use to
signal the warriors of their chamber,
and to put the fear of Sigmar into the
hearts of their foes.

The tones of the battle-horn sound
different to every denizen of the
Mortal Realms. The Stormcast
Eternals hear crisp notes directing
them to advance, strike or retreat
– the sounds of Order itself. The
Chaos-oppressed peoples of the
realms hear a bright call to arms, a
blast that dispels despair and brings
hope where there was none. The
enemies of the Stormcast Eternals,
however, hear the wrathfu l cries
of Sigmar, and the roar of thunder
clashing in their ears.

The Knights-Heraldor use their
horns to exhort the warriors around
them to greater efforts, and the
celestial energy imbued in each note
invigorates their comrades. These
trumpeters may instead use their
horns to release an almighty blast
that rolls across the battlefield like
thunder. When a Knight-Heraldor
does so, the ground shakes, and
the forces arrayed against them are
forced to abandon their positions
as ruins and fortresses tremble to
their foundations.

KNIGHTS-AZYROS

Starblade in one hand and celestial
beacon in the other, a Knight-Azyros
is a potent messenger of the Heavens,
tasked with bringing Sigmar’s light
to the darkest reaches of the realms.
They forge vital alliances in their role
as ambassadors, gathering the forces
of Order under the God-King’s
banner. Undaunted by darkness
and borne by swift wings, Knights-
Azyros are well suited to scouting
roles, acting as leading members in
both the Vanguard Chambers and
Strike Chambers.

Yet
it is for their celestial beacons
that Knights-Azyros are truly
renowned. Inside these holy artefacts
are captured beams of the pure light
of Azyr ; it is said that Sigmar can
see wherever this sacred light shines,
meaning those who carr y it bring
with them the wisdom and power
of the God-King himself. The light
of Azyr is so powerful that, even
when sealed, these lanterns glow
with a nimbus that guides nearby
Stormcasts in battle,
illuminating
their enemies so that they may smite
them with unerring accuracy.

However,
it is not until the shutters
of a celestial beacon are thrown wide
that its true power manifests. The
Azyrite light is revealed in a brilliant
burst of rays that throws even the
darkest battlefield into glorious
illumination. While this light is
rapturous to the eyes of the faithful,
to Sigmar’s enemies it is a glaring
sunrise that blinds and burns. This
is especially true of the followers
of Chaos, who suffer searing
agonies when such light falls upon
them, spasming in torment before
smouldering to nothingness.

KNIGHTS-VEXILLOR

Within every Stormhost it is the duty
of the Knights-Vexillor to bear the
banners of Azyr into battle. None
question their right to do so, for
that honour is not predetermined
by their reforging, but hard-won in
the gruelling arena combats of the
Gladitorium – contests of arms from
which only a single champion may
emerge. With their martial prowess
so proven in the Celestial Realm,
the Knights-Vexillor stride mortal
battlefields as radiant beacons of
Order, stirring their kin to acts of
greater valour.

Some Knights-Vexillor choose to
carr y into battle blazing meteoric
standards, twin-tailed icons aflame
with the brilliant light of Azyr.
Others bear aloft rich heaven-
wrought pennants, their proud
pageantry untainted by the filth of
war. Like sunbeams cutting through
dark clouds, Knights-Vexillor
blaze a lambent trail through the
deepest ranks of the enemy, bringing
Sigmar’s light to wherever the dark
violence of battle is fiercest.

As heralds of Sigmar’s storm, the
Knights-Vexillor are a fearful sight
for any adversary, yet their power
far exceeds the symbolic. With a
sonorous cry, a Knight-Vexillor can
call upon the Heavens themselves.
Those who bear a pennant of
the stormbringer can cause the
magic of his standard to thrum to
a crescendo, unleashing furious
hurricane winds that carr y his allies
across the battlefield in a blitzing
cloud of lightning. If the Knight-
Vexillor carries a meteoric standard,
he can call down fiery comets from
the glowering skies above to impact
catastrophically in the enemy’s
midst. Mortal survivors from these
terrible battlefields have said that
such events evoke the lightning
bolts Sigmar himself hurls from
High Sigendil, far above the sky
palaces he raised long ago to spurn
the darkness.

KNIGHTS-ZEPHYROS

During the Age of Myth, Sigmar
battled many feral monsters and
rapacious demigods, striking them
down to protect his tribes. One
such beast was Ulfdengnarl, the
Great Wolf of the Howling Winds,
and as the white-pelted beast died,
Sigmar trapped its endless, baying
cry in a cr ystal shard. It was this
divine relic that the God-King
employed during the creation of his
first Knights-Zephyros.

Mortal killers and assassins of Chaos
champions,
these lone warriors
were imbued with Ulfdengnarl’s
chilling cry as they passed through
the flickering crucible of reforging.
Those that survived were blessed
with the Great Wolf
’s inhuman
instincts, his gale-force swiftness
and his single-minded gift for
hunting prey.

Sigmar sent the first of his Knights-
Zephyros to join the Vanguard
Auxi liar y Chambers, there to fight

alongside the Rangers in the wildest
and furthest flung war zones of the
realms. The Knight-Zephyros’ role
is simple, and symbiotic with that of
the warriors they fight alongside.

Each is assigned a singular target, a
nemesis that is invariably the most
powerful and influential enemy
leader operating in that region. They
use the Rangers’ attack as cover to
close with their target, following
in the slipstream of their wind-
shifting mounts and employing
blistering speed to catch the victim
unawares. Fighting with whirling
blades, leaping and dodging as fast as
thought, the Knight-Zephyros rains
blows upon their victim. Their attack
is relentless, savage, a hailstorm of
perfectly placed strikes that soon
finds a chink in even the most skilled
enemy’s guard. Hacked and hewn,
the victim falls,
leaving his warriors
leaderless and engulfed in a panic
that the Rangers are quick to exploit
with lethal efficiency.

KNIGHTS-QUESTOR

Unlike the other officers of the Strike
Chambers, the Knights-Questor bear
no burden of command. It is not
for them to marshal the chambers
or lead them to war. Instead, each
Knight-Questor carries a far greater
weight – a quest bestowed upon them
by Sigmar that often impels them to
strike out into the untamed realms
alone, there to find the destiny for
which they were chosen.

The geas which so rules them differs
from knight to knight. Some wi l l
be tasked with the destruction of a
particular foe, and wi l l hunt them
tirelessly across burning plains,
uncharted seas and shattered
mountains. Others have far more
esoteric tasks – such as bearing a
jewelled egg to the heights of the
the Skybite Mountains in Ghur,
or delivering a cr yptic message
to a Swifthawk Agent outpost in
Hysh, never knowing what purpose
their quest served. Whatever their
task, it rules each Knight-Questor
completely. No commander can
order a Knight-Questor from their
allotted path, though some might
be sorely tempted to try, given the
Knight’s
strength at arms. Theirs is
a holy duty, and they are given free
rein to pursue it by whatever means
are necessary.

On completing their allotted quest, a
Knight-Questor might be reassigned
to a different position within the
Stormhost, but more commonly they
find themselves once more setting
out into the Mortal Realms, the next
command of the God-King ringing
in their ears.

‘I

found poor Hathrek,

in the end,

that Darkoath wanderer who through

necessity had fought as my brother

in the

silvered tower of

the Summoner. Through

a hundred trials we passed, and I dared

to hope I had turned him from his dire

fate. Yet when I tracked him down he

had been wholly claimed by the Dark

Gods, more daemon than man.

I cleaned

my blade in sorrow that day.’

KNIGHTS-INCANTOR

The Knight-Incantor is a gifted
stormcaller, able to summon
hurricane winds and gales of
mystical energy from the firmament
to smite those who cannot be slain
by conventional weapons. Those who
ignite a Knight-Incantor’s wrath
soon find themselves battling against
a living tempest.

The Knights-Incantor of the
Sacrosanct Chambers are second
only to the Lord-Arcanums in
rank, and these mages often lead
brotherhoods in the absence of the
chamber’s commander. With their
rods of office, the Knights-Incantor
can channel the energy of the storm
into a raging hurricane, or send
crackling bolts of arcane power to
smite those who would defy Sigmar’s
will. Many carr y scrolls imbued
with potent void magic, relics able
to dispel the hostile emanations or
baleful spells of the fiends they face
in battle. But of all their powers, it is
the Knight-Incantor’s ability to call
down the storm with their voice that
is their foremost tool.

When attending the Anvil of the
Apotheosis, the Knight-Incantor
sings the music of the spheres, voice
splitting, overlapping and winding
into several celestial melodies the
better to calm and reorient the souls
that undergo the transformation into
a Stormcast Eternal. That voice can
also be used as a powerful weapon.
With a rising chant, the Knight-
Incantor draws in motes of magic,
marshalling celestial power from a
zephyr into a howling gale that blasts
their enemies across the battlefield.
With a cry of exultation, the storm-
mage sets loose a shock of lightning,
or summons a downpour of freezing
hail to douse the fires of anarchy.

Such is the Knight-Incantors’ power
over the arcane they can even sing a
refrain that draws spiritual energy
toward them, which they capture in
a vial carried at the waist. In times of
great need the Knight-Incantor can
hurl one of these spirit flasks into
the midst of the foe, there to shatter
with a thunderous explosion that sets
loose a frenzied storm-spirit. Those
nearby are ravaged by wild celestial
energies – be they friend or foe.

ERRANT-QUESTORS

While the Knights-Questor
are appointed tasks by Sigmar,
the Errant-Questors come
to their ca l ling on their own
after becoming consumed
by a single righteous notion.
The lone sur vivor of a retinue
might become obsessed
with vengeance for his lost
comrades, for instance.
Another might receive a
recurring vision in which he
sees himself defeating some
monstrous foe, and strives
from that point on to make
that vision a reality – though
he does not know from
whence such visions come.
With their purpose burning
inside them like a brand, the
Errant-Questors fa l l into a
fugue state, whereupon they
are placed into a cell. Some wi l l
find a kind of peace in their
rest, and be able to return to
their duties with their fierce
yearning diminished.

Others come back to their
faculties with that burning
desire unquenched. These
individuals find themselves
clad in the armour of the
Errant-Questor, a storm gladius
strapped to their hip and a
rune-etched greatblade lying
before them. How these gifts
are bestowed is a mystery, as
none may enter the cell of an
Errant presumptive. What is
cer tain is that, though Sigmar
himself has never said as
much, these individuals have
the God-King’s tacit blessing
to resolve their obsession,
and are released from their
Stormhost to pursue their quest
without hesitation.

KNIGHTS-VENATOR

Knights-Venator are masters of the
ranged kill, possessed of a swiftness
that no mortal can reckon with.
In a single blur of movement they
can let fly whole flurries of arrows,
each volley launched with ruthless
aquiline instinct to shoot towards
their target’s weakest spots.

A Knight-Venator’s weapon of
choice is the powerful realmhunter’s
bow. This magnificent artefact is
capable of delivering precise shots
at great range. The warnings of such
attacks are scant if present at all,
ki l ling strikes sometimes preceded
by nothing more than the faint
sigh of unquiet air. Like the quiver
that holds them, each of a Knight-
Venator’s
arrows is a thing of magic,
crafted by one of the Six Smiths in
the hallowed fletching rooms of
the Sigmarabulum.

As quickly as it can be emptied, a
Knight-Venator’s quiver refills, so
that the archer is never without their
heavenly ammunition. But there is
one missile that takes many hours to
reappear, such is its sacred power –
the star-fated arrow, a deadly artefact
that can fell even the mightiest
of foes.

Often acting as an officer of the
Vanguard Chambers, every Knight-
Venator must show his mastery
over the celestial sphere by seeking
out and bonding with a Star-eagle.
These predators dwell in the aetheric
clouds high above the Broken World,
hunting the ethereal shoals that drift
there from the lost reaches of the
cosmos. Indeed, it is said by some
that the birds themselves are the
essences of once-great stars given
avian form, heavenly familiars able
to commune telepathically with
like-minded souls.

It is likely this rumour stems from
the Star-eagle’s
ability to transform
its body into a burning, crackling
spear of light when it flies at fu l l
speed – should the great raptor dive
straight through the torso of its prey,
it can slay instantly, no matter how
massive or well-armoured the beast
in question. To an observer it seems
as if the victim has been pierced by a
shooting star.

TORNUS THE REDEEMED

Tornus the Redeemed, once known as Torglug the
Despised, is the first of a new breed of Stormcast
Eternal. A native of the Realm of Life, he was born
Tornus of the Everdawn Tribe,
the ancestral guardians
of the sacred water-springs known as the Lifewells.
When the armies of Nurgle came for the Everdawn
Tribe, Tornus fought long and hard to protect those
holy sites. When he was finally overcome, he was
thrown into the Pit of Filth, and every manner of
foulness the Nurgle hosts could find was pitched
in with him. Befouled in mind and body, Tornus
knew the only way to escape death was to embrace
Nurgle. After seventy-seven painful nights he finally
gave in, and was corrupted despite – or perhaps
because of – his stubborn heroics. Thus was Tornus
transformed into Torglug. Rising through the ranks of
the Rotbringers, Torglug received foul blessings from
his new patron, growing to lead vast armies in the
Plague God’s name. Turning against his former allies,
Torglug seeded the lands of Ghyran with pestilence
and plague – earning the name the Despised by
those who once called him brother. Pleased with his
offerings, Nurgle rewarded Torglug with a bodyguard

of Putrid Blightkings and the honour of corrupting
the Lifewells he had once stood sentinel over. It was
a task the Nurgle lord accepted with twisted pride,
raising the fortifications known as the Fangs of Decay
to cage the power of life. He led the invasion that drove
Alarielle from her final haven, and he almost captured
the goddess before he was bested by the newly
risen Celestant-Prime.

Recognising a buried seed of valour w ithin him, the
avatar of Sigmar smote Torglug with Ghal Maraz ,
k i l l ing him, but a lso redeeming what remained of his
long-buried soul. That essence blazed to Sigmaron,
where Tornus was reforged as a Knight-Venator.
Thus, Tornus returned to Ghyran, seeking vengeance.
He slew Bloab Rotspawned during the War for the
Scabrous Sprawl and joined the search for the source
of the poisoned fog that hung over the Genesis Gate.
In the batt le that followed he slew the Great Unclean
One Pustrol, a l lowing A lar iel le to overcome the
Glottk in , the triplets that led the forces of Nurgle.
The Genesis Gate was won that day, but st i l l Tornus
fears that he and his adoptive Stormhost w i l l stand
forever apar t .

HEROES OF LEGEND

The Stormcast Eternals have fought ceaselessly over the long and blood-soaked years since they first came to the
Mortal Realms. The impact they have made is not only physical, but also spiritual – their foremost leaders are
spoken of in awed whispers across the lands. Some amongst them have already become living legends.

Heroes of Legend

AVENTIS FIRESTRIKE

Just as the lightning shatters the oak
to leave a pillar of flame in its wake,
Aventis Firestrike is not only the
stormbolt, but its burning aftermath.
His power over the magic of the
realms comes from a glowing coal of
anger lodged deep within his chest,
which his many acolytes say is the
source of his famously foul temper.

When the floating citadels of the
Agloraxi crossed the Flamescar
Plateau during the Age of Myth,
that wizardly order came under
attack from a host of daemons. In
a matter of hours, the ancient magi
destroyed the fiendish beings in a
rain of fire. The ascendancy of these
mages offended the Blood God, who
swept his great reality-splitting blade
across the skies of the Great Parch,
all but destroying the Agloraxi.

Avantis is one of the few mages
who can trace his lineage to that
cataclysmic day. When he was a
mortal known as Avante Fireson,
he dedicated his life to fighting the
Bloodbound worshippers of Khorne.
He did so with plot and scheme as
well as sword, for he knew their
leaders were not only blood-crazed
madmen but also conquerors with
sound and cunning minds. Over the
years he became known to them as
the Fire Soul, a figure of hate and
fear amongst the reavers of Khul’s
Ravage. Eventually, seeking revenge,
they struck at the citadels of Avante’s
people. Dozens of towers were pulled
down, and the families and serfs of
his nation were hunted through the
streets. After seeing pillars of smoke
on the far horizon when returning
from the war front, Avante hastened
back to the city.

Upon finding the shattered remnants
of his home, he took the Everburning
Coal – a sphere of primordial
realmstone he had studied at length
over the years – from its filigree
gold casket. Transmuting his body
to a form of fire, he forced himself
to consume it whole. Fighting down
the raw agony inside him, he then
took human form once more. He
passed out, and awoke the next day
surrounded by fire. Its flames did
not harm him. He quickly learned
to take the excruciating pain in his
chest and channel
it into a source
of devastating magic, incinerating
all those in his path to purge the
remains of the arcane metropolis.
Only when a group of frenzied
headtakers dropped from their
skull-mound on the roofs above
to slam Avante into the cobbles
was his rampage finally ended. But
in his unstinting attack, Avante
had caught the eye of Sigmar high
above. In Azyr, he was remade as a
Lord-Arcanum in recognition of his
incredible magical talent, and took
the name Aventis Firestrike.

Aventis was a passionate soul, but
pure of heart, and he soon forged
friendships with celestial beasts as
well as his fellow Stormcast. When
the Shyish necroquake cascaded
across reality, he convinced his
kindred spirit, the Tauralon Loithar,
to go with him back to his homeland.
Loithar agreed, albeit reluctantly,
for
the beast had recently sired a clutch
of young. The two proved a powerful
alliance, and since that day Aventis
has won such acclaim that Sigmar
has sworn him the Magister of
Hammerhal. The old flames of anger
in Firestrike’s heart are magnified by
the resentments of his steed; those
with the temerity to wound the rider
or his Tauralon only ignite their fur y
all the more. Aventis wi l l not allow
himself to rest until he has claimed
a Chaos worshipper’s
life for every
citizen of the Great Parch that died
during the Red Century – a number
counted in the millions.

from her targeting throne into
thin air. She never hit the ground.
She had fought long and hard, and
Sigmar had need of her ski l ls.

Solbright was reforged in Azyr as a
Lord-Arcanum, and given command
of the Shimmersouls. She soon
proved herself a pioneer as well as
a leader, for she has long known
the power of pure magic, and has
mastered turning it into a weapon
– it was Astreia that first bottled
spirit energy to use as an explosive
device. Her arcane talents are now
even more impressive than when she
was mortal. The scintillating magic
she specialises in is the quintessence
of Hyshian energy distilled into
pure beams of exorcising force.
Though she has left the dazzling
science of her old homeland behind,
and though she now owes more to
Azyr than she does to Hysh, she
can still summon blinding sun-
rays capable of consuming even an
ethereal creature.

Solbright and her kindred have
slain or banished many immortal
creatures – the Red Brides of van
Kiarthus, the Liche of Fenn Dread,

the Lord Wamphyr of Decrepita
and the Unliving Monks of Dhostos
Varne amongst them. Each has risen
again, whether reappearing in a
coffin, forming around a phylactery
or canoptic jar, or reincarnating
in the body of a newborn – and
each has later been studied in turn.
As yet, none have shown the kind
of immortality Solbright believes
vital to her cause. Every morning
she gathers her hopes anew,
for she
knows that the fate of the Stormcast
Eternals is at stake.

Ultimately, she hopes to one day
find a creature that can not only
return to fu l l strength after each
death, but become even stronger for
it – for whatever arcane or spiritual
process leads to that ability, she wi l l
deconstruct it in the laboratories of
Sigmaron and attempt to emulate it
in her chamber’s future reforgings.
Thus far, to her growing disquiet,
Solbright has heard of only one
entity in all the realms that can
claim to have returned from death
stronger and more determined
than before.

That being is Nagash.

ASTREIA SOLBRIGHT

Astreia Solbright, known to those
in her chamber as the Lady Arcane,
is a woman of fierce intellect with
a logical and incisive mind. The
foremost Sacrosanct Chamber
of the Hammers of Sigmar – the
Shimmersouls – follows her vision
as they search the realms for a cure
to the flaw that slowly erodes their
kindred. In slaying those creatures
that are ostensibly immortal, and
studying the process that revives
them, the Shimmersouls learn
more and more about the nature of
eternity. Thus far, their quest to find
and slay creatures in possession of
eternal life has brought Astreia into
conflict with one type of foe above
all others – the blood-drinking
vampires of Shyish.

Though laconic and circumspect,
Astreia has an iron certainty to
her that means those around her
are usually swayed to her cause by
just a few well-chosen words. Since
her second reforging she has been
surrounded by a corona of static
electricity that causes her flaxen
hair to stand out around her head.
She wears that halo of energy like
a crown – even when helmed for
battle, she is limned with a glow
that marks her out as a champion of
surpassing power.

Her thoughtful and precise conduct
has endeared her to the Celestial
Dracoline Kazra – for the creature
respects those who speak with
actions rather than the loud, self-
assured roars of a warrior. When on
the hunt, the two can be surprisingly
stealthy, an attribute that has proven
useful indeed when prowling Shyish.

Solbright originally hails from the
scintillating desert palaces of the
Great Hysh Vista. There she was a
Supplicant of the Great Lens, that
prismatic edifice that stood atop
the miles-high Pillar of Truths.
That construction is so massive, so
high-reaching, that Solbright spent
her whole life up there, from her
early days as a polisher-serf to her
crowning achievement as a Lens
Magus. When the Great Lens was
used to burn the mutated drakes that
assailed it during the height of the
Age of Chaos, Solbright was pitched

NEAVE BLACKTALON

Neave Blacktalon is a living weapon.
Her blinding speed, preternatural
senses and terrifying strength of
wi l l make her the nemesis of her
prey. How long she has stalked
Sigmar’s enemies is unclear,
for
like many others, Neave’s war
began long before Sigmar officially
acknowledged her existence. It seems
likely that dozens of demagogues,
despots and slavelords have felt the
bite of the Whirlwind Axes, but of
this Neave does not speak; her only
concern is her duty to Sigmar, and
the death of her next mark.

In battle, Neave is like a streak of
golden light, hurtling into the enemy
lines and attacking her victims
with relentless ferocity. Effortlessly
she scales high walls, vaults over
enemy barricades and evades the
most devious traps. Those who seek
to bar Neave’s path soon learn the
depths of their mistake as she rips
through their ranks in a gory blur.
Corpses topple in her wake, heads

and limbs lopped, blood jetting in
arterial sprays. Her prey follows suit
soon enough, for Neave’s assault is
blisteringly swift and aggressive, and
neither parr ying blade nor magical
barrier can deny her. She is an
instrument of Sigmar’s will, and she
wi l l accept neither defeat nor death
until her duty is done.

Neave fights most commonly
alongside the Shadowhammers, the
most decorated Vanguard Auxi liar y
Chamber of the Hammers of Sigmar.
Their leader, Lord-Aquilor Danastus,
pushes his warriors hard, and prides
himself on their being amongst the
most lethal of their kind. He has
further trained his warriors in the
specialist tactics of suppressive fire
and close assault, allowing them
to rapidly pick apart enemy forces.
Fighting alongside Blacktalon,
who is both champion and their
talisman, the Shadowhammers have
achieved victory against vast forces
that should have been beyond their
capabilities to overcome.

GAVRIEL SUREHEART

Gavriel Sureheart was born to
two slaves held in the Khornate
citadel known as Ratspike. There,
the citadel’s masters competed in
an arena to slaughter as many of
their victims as possible. As a child,
Gavriel was known only as Grub,
and his life was miserable. His main
task was to fetch buckets fu l l of
blood from the troughs at the side of
the arena, bring them to the walls of
the citadel and pour them through
the mouths of the castle’s gargoyles
– for Ratspike had a reputation as
a place where blood flowed in great
measure. His back was no stranger to
the lash, and he found little comfort
in the vacant stares of his brethren,
for they too had had the spirit beaten
out of them. Or so it seemed.

Upon his coming of age, Grub was
given a mask and spear, and forced
as fodder into the arena. But Grub’s
overlords did not realise he had
watched,
learned and trained for
ten years straight. He had used the
sharpened handle of his mop in place
of a spear, with his metal bucket as
a cestus – as had those few fellow
slaves who joined him in midnight
training sessions. He proved a
revelation in the arena, and the week
of battle following his debut saw
the gargoyles’ maws run thick with
rivers of blood. A month of slaughter
culminated with Grub’s
spear in
the throat of Ratspike’s king, and an
armed revolt that saw Grub and his
fellows escape the citadel. Yet
they
were run down that same night.

As Grub was bound, his neck
feeling the bite of the axe, Sigmar
snatched him from the wilderness
in a blinding flash of lightning and
bore him to Azyr. He was reforged as
Gavriel, and proved an exceptional
fighter in the Gladitorium trials –
arguably he had trained for them
all his life. Since that day he has
swapped spear for sigmarite blade
and buckler for broad shield. He has
proved a capable Lord-Celestant,
leading a brotherhood of Liberators
to war against tyrants and dark kings
wherever they are found. Few can
match him in single combat, for the
memories of his former life are still
sharp, and he has the strength of one
given a second chance for revenge.

VANDUS HAMMERHAND

The Lord-Celestant of the Hammers
of Sigmar and the embodiment
of the vengeful storm, Vandus
Hammerhand has already carved
himself a place in history. He was the
first of his Stormhost to be reforged,
and his Warrior Chamber was the
first to strike back at the dominion of
Chaos upon the Igneous Delta at the
dawn of the Age of Sigmar.

Since his reforging, Vandus has
proven himself a gifted leader.
Originally a smith-lord of the
Direbrand Tribe, he is able to shape
the rage of his Warrior Chamber as
he once tempered and refined the
iron of his trade. Underneath his
dutiful aspect, however, he desires
little more than to settle his blood
debt with the tyrannica l warlord
Korghos Khul.

Long ago, when Vandus was merely
Vendell Blackfist, the Direbrand
Tribe was conquered – along with
much of the Flamescar Plateau and
the south of Aqshy’s Great Parch – by
the ravening warband known as the
Goretide. But for Vendell’s
refusal
to despair,
the last traces of his tribe
would have been lost, just as with so
many others.

Though Vendell had left his years
as an impetuous warrior behind to
better forge the destiny of his tribe,
his outrage drove him to battle once
more. As the Goretide crashed across
the hills of the Direbrands, he took
up his forge maul and battered his
way through the blood-mad warriors
that had invaded his smithy. He cried
a wordless challenge to the armoured
king in their midst – Korghos Khul
himself. To the Lord of Khorne it
was no more than the bleating of a
goat bound for slaughter.

Vendell saw his warrior sons cut
down violently by Lord Khul – where
that fiend’s dread axe swung, reality
itself bled, and Vendell’s young men
did not fall so much as shrink and
disappear entirely.
In fur y Vendell
charged in, but traded no more
than two blows with Khul before a
sharp kick drove him to his knees.
Winded, Vendell snarled up to face
with defiance the blow that would
end his misery forever.

It did not fall. Light flashed across
the smithy’s sprawl, and Vendell was
snatched up to High Azyr,
there to
be reforged – for in opposing one
with the blessings of Khorne he had
proved himself worthy. Since that
day, Vandus has put his duty first; his
exceptional
leadership and skill at
arms have seen him earn the respect
of many Stormhosts and the trust of
the God-King himself. Indeed, the
visions that assail Vandus in times of
high tension are proof enough that
his destiny is a powerful one.

It was Vandus, alongside Thostos
Bladestorm, that recovered Ghal
Maraz from the Hanging Valleys
of Anvrok. In that time, it seemed
he could not fail, for he and his
Dracoth, Calanax struck surely
wherever they fought. When he
met Archaon in single combat atop
Mount Kronus, all that changed.
He was cut in twain by the Slayer of
Kings for his defiance, the Three-
Eyed King running his fingers
through the Lord-Celestant’s
soul as
it returned to Azyr.

Since that day he has been blighted
by ever stranger visions, and even
Calanax, his old friend and steed, is
sometimes ill at ease around him.
Yet
these insights are not entirely
a curse. Thanks to the strange
warnings of the figure of pure energy
Vandus thinks of as the Lightning
Man, he foresaw the coming of the
Shyish Nadir, and brought warning
to Sigmar on his throne.

Though Vandus wants nothing more
than to slay his nemesis Khul –
especially now that the blood moon
once named Orb Infernia hangs low
over the Ashlands of Aqshy – he
realises that he has a greater duty.
He is a Hammer of Sigmar, and the
first of their Lord-Celestants to boot;
he has the eyes of the Free Peoples
as well as the Stormhosts upon him.
As something of a figurehead for
Sigmar’s vaulted armies, Vandus
must put his personal vendetta
aside once more, no matter the toll
that takes on his soul, for he cannot
afford to be anything less than the
ultimate exemplar of his kind.

The Shield of the Free Peoples

74

THE SHIELD OF THE FREE PEOPLES

The Redeemer Conclaves are the heart of most Stormcast battle-lines. Be they from the Strike Chambers that first
began Sigmar’s crusade, or the Sacrosanct Chambers that joined it after the Shyish necroquake, they are centred
around the cadre of hardened infantr y that acts as anvil to the hammer of the lords that lead them.

LIBERATORS

Most numerous of the Stormcast
Eternals – and the burning soul of
the Stormhosts – are the Redeemers.
The Redeemer Conclaves are split
into retinues, the most common of
which are the Liberators.

Each warrior of these proud bands
fights with the ferocity of a lion,
wielding Heaven-wrought weapons
and wearing burnished armour that
is proof against all but the strongest
blows. The Liberators are Sigmar’s
foot soldiers, hardy souls with
an innate sense of justice. When
they march out from the lightning
storms, evil kings bar their fortresses
and summon their warriors, for they
know the day of reckoning is at hand.

Most Liberators wield a holy
warhammer in one hand and a broad
tower shield of sigmarite in the
other. They are experts at deflecting
the attacks of their adversaries, be
they arrows, bolts or sword strikes,
– even those that bypass the shield
are usually deflected by the closely
fitting plates of burnished armour
behind. Patience is a virtue, as
those who have endured the Long
Wait know all too well, and the
Liberators are in no hurry to take
their vengeance. Instead they pick
their moment – once their shieldwall
has endured the enemy charge or
hemmed the foe into close confines,
the Liberators wi l l strike. Down
falls the hammer, and bloody justice
is dealt.

There are those amongst the
Liberators that favour keen blades
in place of hammers – and some,
notably those of the Celestial
Vindicators,
that prefer to fight with
a sword in each hand. Not for these
the slow and deliberate march –
instead they fight as a whirlwind of
razored edges, spinning, cutting and
thrusting until there is nothing left
of the foe but dismembered limbs.
Often, the most experienced warrior
in a retinue, besides the Prime that
leads it, wi l l wield a two-handed
grandblade or grandhammer – a
weapon devastating enough to slay
an ogor in a single strike.

When they take to the field of battle,
Liberators are not only the main
strength of their army – they are
also its foundation. They exemplify
the quest to overcome those who
subjugate the people of the realms.
Those who are reforged as Liberators
do not usually hark from the lordly
echelons that defied Chaos from a
position of privilege, but from the
ordinary men and women who,
pushed to breaking point, took up
arms against their oppressors. Now,
reforged into Sigmar’s armies, they
seek to overthrow the rule of Chaos
wherever it is to be found, and in
doing so, strike a note of fear in all
who would take the path to darkness
rather than light.

The most famous retinues of
Liberators are the first and most
stalwart of their kind. Those of
the Hammers of Sigmar delivered
the Emberkin from the tyranny of
the Goretide, while their brethren
of the Hallowed Knights slew the
skaven warlord Twiskskien,
freeing
thousands of human slaves to be
welcomed into Sigmar’s fledgeling
cities in the Realm of Beasts. Some
of those that were saved have become
the elders of their respective cities,
each with their own tale of the deeds
of these warriors, and of how those
who stray from Sigmar’s light are
ruthlessly slain by their hammers.

STEELHEART’S CHAMPIONS

Though none amongst the Stormhosts realise
it, Severin Steelheart and his fellow Liberators –
Angharad Brightshield and Obryn the Bold – have as
critical a role in the future of the Stormcast Eternals
as the Sacrosanct Chambers deployed to secure it.
They were once simple Liberators, sent to reinforce
the Knight-Questor Kantar Gloryborn on his mission
to delve into the bleached ruins of Shadespire and
investigate rumours of a strange, magical glass that
held power over mortality. Since becoming trapped
in the soul-torn reflection that is the Mirrored City,
they have learned more of shadeglass than any other in
Sigmar’s hosts.

Fighting through the undead denizens of the Desert
of Bones, Gloryborn and Steelheart made their way
into the desiccated, soulless remnants of the city
that had once been Shadespire. There the Liberators
became separated from their fellows during a battle
with a gang of brutish orruks that were sacking the
Necropolis of Trense. That attack was so intense that a
section of the necropolis fell away, plunging Steelheart
and his fellows into the labyrinth beneath.

Seeking to reunite with the rest of the brotherhood,
Steelheart and his fellows came through the cave
networks to find their way blocked by an underground
river – made not just of water, but of trillions of
angular pieces of broken glass. Wading across it,
they were assailed by a great surge of water, which
carried them over the Waterfall of Shards. When they
emerged, half-drowned, they were no longer in Shyish,
but the twilight realm that is the Mirrored City.

Since that day, Steelheart and his warriors have been
trapped, unable to find their way out and forced to
constantly battle the countless warbands of foes
who have also found their way into this place. It is
an endless cycle, for even should they be overcome,
they awake the next day to face their ordeal again,
for all in the Mirrored City are cursed by Nagash to
endure an eternity of inescapable death. Steelheart
and his champions did once find the Waterfall of
Shards flowing backwards, but learned it would only
bear the weight of one of their number. Instead of
separating, they sent a cache of soul-rich shadeglass
back to Shyish, hoping it would be found by their old
comrades so they could unlock the mysteries within.

SEQUITORS

The line infantr y of a Sacrosanct
Chamber is comprised of its
Sequitors, stern warriors who
channel the tempest through the
magical weaponry bequeathed to
them by Sigmar. To be struck by
such a warrior is to feel the energy
of the storm discharging with
thunderclap force.

Sequitors do not consider themselves
to be true mages, being at the first
stage of their arcane mastery, but to
mortal eyes they are supernatural to
a terrifying degree. Towering over
the people they are sent to defend,
each Sequitor has the strength of
three stout men. They wear armour
of burning sigmarite, thunder
rumbles with their war cries, and
their weapons glow blue with the
power of High Azyr. When they fight
as one, a corona of energy crackles
around them, building in intensity to
form crowns of corposant that mark
the Sequitors as the living weapons
of Sigmar.

Key to a Sequitor’s power is their
weaponry. Most wield a heavy and
angular stormsmite maul in one
hand, and a broad soulshield –
somewhat like that of a Liberator –
in the other. Yet
there the similarities

to the rank-and-file of the Warrior
Chambers end. A Sequitor is able to
channel magic into the armaments
they carr y to war – imbuing
either their weapon or shield with
aetheric power, then moving this
enchantment between them to weave
fluidly between stalwart defence and
blistering attack.

a daemon-possessed blade or a
Hexwraith’s
soul-cutting scythe.
When a stormsmite maul is infused
with the energy flowing from the
Sequitor’s soul, it discharges the
force of each strike with terrible
effect, stunning the adversary’s mind
into thunderstruck inactivity as it
mangles and scorches their flesh.

Still more formidable are the two-
handed maces used by the strongest
of the Sequitors’ number. These
stormsmite greatmaces have each
been laid against the head of Ghal
Maraz, the Great Shatterer itself,
for a night and a day – and over
that time they have inherited some
of its godly power. The thunderous
impact of such a weapon can tear
through baroque plate or chitinous
mutation as if it were paper-thin.
When such a weapon lands a solid
blow upon unprotected flesh, it wi l l
blast its target to nothing more than
a scattering of cinders.

The true purpose of these weapons
is not to engage mortal foes, but
to slay the otherworldly. Should
a stormsmite greatmace strike a
creature not of the waking world,
such as a gheist or daemon, it can
blast apart that entity forever,
banishing it from the Mortal Realms.

When a Sequitor’s tools of war are
energised with the innate magic
of the wielder, the might of the
storm flows through them, causing
them to glow blue with arcane
force. A soulshield so empowered
can turn aside even a blow from

The Eyes of the Eagle

THE EYES OF THE EAGLE

A blitzing storm of projectiles hammers down from the skies as the Stormcast Eternals advance. No normal volley
of arrows is this, but a streaking hurricane of magically imbued ammunition that can scorch flesh and obliterate
skulls with even a glancing blow. To face a Justicar Conclave is to know the k i l ling fur y of the tempest.

JUDICATORS

Where the Liberators are Sigmar’s
swift sword and strong shield,
the Judicators are his far-flung
lightning bolts. Standing behind the
broad shields of the Liberators, the
warriors of the Justicar Conclaves
loose volleys of crackling arrows and
flights of screaming crossbow bolts
that hammer the minions of Chaos
from their feet. Able to shoot their
celestial weapons at great range and
with terrifying speed, the numbers
of the foe arrayed against the
Judicators are immaterial. Judicator
retinues have been known to destroy
forces ten times their number
without suffering a single casualty or
showing the slightest remorse.

Judicators are able to detect evil,
and their punishment is swift and
ruthless. It was Judicators of the
Knights Excelsior that suddenly
ended a parley with the Soulblight
Lord von Drecht when they saw
through his deception. As his
lurking minions were blasted by the
Judicators’ arrows, the vampire was
forced to flee, his plans and armies
in tatters.

CASTIGATORS

Castigators are powerful ranged
support troops, commonly employed
by the Lord-Arcanums of the
Sacrosanct Chambers against
ethereal enemies that can ki l l with
but a touch. These shock troops fire
their deadly projectiles over the
heads of their brothers-in-arms to
detonate in blasts of cerulean force.

The Sacrosanct Chambers value
firepower highly,
for when battling
the spirits of Shyish, destroying them
before they can bring their razored
claws to bear is often the best course
of action. Against an ectoplasmic
enemy, an arrow or iron bolt finds
little purchase, often passing through
the fiendish entity’s body as if it
were no more than shadow. The
Castigators, the ranged firepower

specialists of the chamber, employ
weapons far deadlier and more
inventive than those used by other
ranged fighters.

energy. The ensorcelled breath of the
Stardrake, when unleashed in this
manner, can discorporate a diabolic
creature in an instant.

The thunderhead greatbow is a
miracle of Azyrite science and
ingenuity.
In form it is something
like a heavy crossbow,
though it is
far bulkier – and it needs to be, for
it fires no mere bolt. The projectiles
the greatbow hurls are more akin
to maces, stout of shaft and broad
of head. At their ends are flasks
wrapped in bracing bands of metal,
and it is the contents of these vessels
that is the Castigator’s
true weapon.
They are filled not with liquid,
but with the storm-breath of the
Stardrakes the lords of the Extremis
Chambers ride to war.

The Castigators seek the aid of the
Extremis Chambers’ Stardrakes
whenever they return to High Azyr.
In a sombre dawn ritual, the great
beasts exhale their stormcloud
breath upon the thunderhead maces
arranged carefully in a twelve-
pointed star before them, just as
their forefather breathed life onto the
God-King whilst he still clung to the
core of the world-that-was.

Once that tempestuous energy
has filled each weapon, the
Castigators attune their spirits to
them, the better to wield their fu l l
potential. When empowered by
the spirit energy of the wielder, the
thunderhead greatbow launches
these powerful projectiles with such
force that the impact can punch
through the armour of a Chaos
warrior and crush the ribcage
behind. As the thunderhead mace
strikes the foe, the flask at its head
bursts in a storm of cr ystal shards,
and the energy within is released.
When used against an ethereal
enemy the true potency of these
weapons becomes clear. Should they
strike a wraith or a daemon, or even
shatter on the ground beneath, they
release a stormcloud of aetheric

VANGUARD-RAPTORS

The Justicar Conclave of each
Vanguard Auxi liar y Chamber is
wholly comprised of Vanguard-
Raptors: cadres of reclusive
marksmen who bring formidable
ranged support to the battlefield. The
Vanguard-Raptors are the first gust
of the hurricane, raining death upon
the enemy before the storm winds
strike in fu l l.

The Vanguard-Raptors are utterly
focussed on their battlefield role,
and have honed their skills through
tireless campaigning. Yet
for each
warrior there lies a natural path.
For some Vanguard-Raptors,
the
instinctive hunting mode is close
and immediate, supporting their
allies with rapid bursts of firepower.
These warriors wield hurricane
crossbows capable of delivering
withering salvoes directly into
enemy battle-lines. Tipped with
heavenly sigmarite, their bolts can
punch through plate and bone
alike, throwing the most disciplined
ranks into disarray. For others the
favourable strike is that which is
well-timed and unheralded, and for
this role the fearsome longstrike
crossbow is the perfect weapon.
Poised in remote firing spots,
Vanguard-Raptors
so armed are
easily capable of despatching priority
targets with a single ruinous bolt.

So uncanny is their aim that
some attribute their preternatural
accuracy to the influence of the
Aetherwings soaring high overhead.
Wherever a Vanguard-Raptor hunts,
a noble Aetherwing is never far away,
scouting deftly above the fray or
swooping to defend the Stormcasts
with beak and rapacious claw. The
bond between these birds and the
Vanguard-Raptors
is truly fraternal,

each respecting the other as a
natural predator.
In temperament
too the parallels are great, for like
the Vanguard-Raptors, Aetherwings
are creatures apart, preferring to
keep their own counsel. Their native
haunts are the highest crags of the
Sidereal Mountains in Azyr, and
it is here too that the Vanguard-
Raptors make their lodging, farthest
of all the Rangers from the lights of
Sigmar’s greatest cities.

It is a rare thing indeed for
Vanguard-Raptors
to descend
from their high eyries and walk
the streets of Azyrheim, and when
they do so they carr y a distant and
mysterious air. But never long do
they tarry, as the nesting places of
the Aetherwings must always be
watched, for reasons no Vanguard-
Raptor wi l l tell.

A dnes the Archer watched the rat-things approach,
fur tive and
scampering. She suppressed a shiver of disgust. Outwardly, she
was impassive and unmoving behind the cur tain of lianas, for
even a twitch of movement could betray the presence of her brotherhood
to the paranoid skaven creeping closer. Inwardly,
she felt a burning
contempt for the hunched and inhuman forms, but she channelled it
into imagination rather than action, mentally rehearsing each shot that
would remove another blot on the landscape from Ghyran’s
swathe. A
seven-legged insect crawled across her faceplate,
laying a thin trail of
eggs, but she did not brush it off. She would burn the metal clean later.
Since her reforging, Adnes had been able to see the dark stains upon
the souls of those who had embraced Chaos – to her aura-seeking eyes,
the discolourations of corruption spread through the torso and head of
each verminous warrior like the tendrils of some predatory deepwater
anemone. The sight almost made her lose her composure.
Wait, Adnes, the Judicator told herself. Wait until the first of the rats
tw itches just a little too much, and then loose the–
The nearest of the skaven turned its head towards her, a look of alarm
making its v icious eyes grow w ide, and sniffed the air. Adnes nocked,
drew, and let fly in one smooth motion. The skaven was already diving to
one side, its fellows shrieking as they too sought to leap into cover.
They were fast, supernaturally so. But they were not as fast as a
speeding arrow.
The skaven were taken in the torso, the throat, the abdomen, with only
one loosed shaft missing its mark. Adnes’ second arrow made up for
Godron’s error,
impaling the last rat-thing as it attempted to escape.
The hunt was just beginning.

The Lightning Host

THE LIGHTNING HOST

Bold raiders and expert scouts, the warriors of the Angelos Conclaves are tireless in their quest to slay the
followers of Chaos, always striking from the perfect angle and leaving their quarr y reeling in confusion. Speed
and surprise are amongst the most vital of their weapons in the war against the scions of disorder.

PROSECUTORS

Streaking into battle on wings of
divine light come the Prosecutors,
Sigmar’s avenging angels. These
are warrior heralds, blade-winged
heroes that bring the God-King’s
wrath to his foes. In battle, they
use their swiftness to outflank
their enemies, hurling blasts of
deadly energy before plunging in to
smash the stunned survivors. They
are the divine hammer that slays
from above.

Time and again these highly mobile
strike troops have proved themselves
invaluable to Lord-Celestants,
extending their commander’s

tactical reach like few others can. As
warrior-heralds they frequently form
the spear-tip of a Stormcast attack,
darting ahead of the vanguard to
cast first judgement on the foe, or
swooping to engage vulnerable
targets on the flanks. It is a testament
to their versatility that Prosecutors
are the most common of all retinues
among the Angelos Conclaves.

The Prosecutors’
lightning-fast
mobility is well matched by the
arcane weaponry wrought for them
by the Six Smiths. While mortal
soldiery look to their cumbersome
scabbards and quivers for armament,
Prosecutors simply reach out to

the aether itself, and weapons born
of pure energy manifest in their
hands. Thus do celestial hammers,
stormcall
javelins or even mighty
two-handed tridents offer themselves
to the wielder, coruscating with
heavenly power.

Jinking on their wings of light,
the Prosecutors hurl their ethereal
hammers and javelins at the enemy
before boldly plunging downwards
to meet them in melee, replacement
weapons forming at once in their
expectant hands. Like blazing
meteors they slash the sky, appearing
as portents of great hope to their
allies but great doom to their foes.

SANSON’S FARSTRIDERS

The Farstriders, another Hammers of Sigmar
brotherhood sent to investigate the ruins of
Shadespire, did not enter the Mirrored City in the
same manner as Steelheart’s Champions. Assigned the
task of learning more about the mysterious shadeglass,
Sanson Farstrider sent his Star Falcon, Gyrfalche,
high above the bleached and tumbled cityscape to spy
out potential sites of interest, for much of the city had
already been scoured clean. The creature returned
to Farstrider before the day was out, telepathically
communicating that it had seen a great yawning pit
to the north. The Farstriders made it to the edge of
the pit the next morning, and stared over the lip to
see countless layers of shattered architecture beneath.
Using strong hempen ropes, they rappelled down into
the underground warren.

The Farstriders kept a careful watch on the dark
reaches of their environs, and – when yellow eyes
flickered in their torchlight – fought their first
engagement still dangling from the ropes, their
boltstorm pistols spitting death as they aimed between
the eyes of their attackers. Only when the razor-

sharp shuriken of their skaven ambushers came in
to slash their ropes, rather than being deflected from
their sigmarite armour, were Sanson and his fellows
overcome. One by one they fell into the inky blackness
below, and never hit the bottom.

When the Farstriders awoke, they found themselves
in the shattered necropolis of the Mirrored City. They
oriented themselves soon enough, but the layout of
the cursed city changed with each new dawn, and
even Sanson – a consummate tracker and hunter of
evils – found himself lost before long. He and his kin
have fought countless vile breeds in their quest to
escape, and each has died more than once. Sanson is
the first to admit that were it not for the sixth sense
of the solemn Almeric Eagle-eye, and the expert
swordsmanship of the wandering duellist Elias
Swiftblade, that number would have been far higher.
Since they discovered a relic belonging to one of the
ancient Katophranes,
they have been under attack near
every day,
facing skaven, orruks, mercenary duardin,
mirror-born doppelgangers and even ghost-like figures
in the guise of Stormcast Liberators. Still they fight on,
although they see no end in sight.

VANGUARD-HUNTERS

The Vanguard-Hunters are the
elite infantr y of the Vanguard
Auxi liar y Chambers. Most among
their number are battle-hardened
veterans, having been honoured
with the role of Ranger upon
their second reforging. Unlike the
swift Vanguard-Palladors or the
sharpshooting Vanguard-Raptors,
the Vanguard-Hunters are tactically
flexible and experts at utilising the
terrain to their advantage. Theirs
is not the domain of stealth and
subterfuge, however, but of daring
raids and brazen guerrilla warfare
that requires them to relocate
constantly. More than once has a
keep’s gatehouse been stormed by
a unit of Vanguard-Hunters who
scaled its walls during the confusion
of battle, or an ar ti l ler y battery been
ambushed and destroyed in what
its crew believed to be the perfect
defensible position.

More so even than the other Rangers,
Vanguard-Hunters wi l l often spend
prolonged periods of time in any
given theatre of war, building up
an intimate knowledge of their
environment. This alone would
make them excellent forward scouts,
but there is one curious artefact
which elevates their fieldcraft to

supernatural
levels: the astral
compass. Devised by the wizards of
the Collegiate Arcane in Azyrheim,
this strange contraption allows
the bearer to deftly navigate the
impossible geometries of the Mortal
Realms. In the hands of a Vanguard-
Hunter,
it becomes an invaluable
tool that enables their unit to attack
the enemy from the direction they
least expect.

The weapons carried by the
Vanguard-Hunters are well-suited
to their role within the Stormhosts.
Heavy-bladed swords and short-
hafted axes are as effective at hacking
through brush and briar on flanking
manoeuvres through dense terrain
as they are the flesh of the servants of
Chaos. Boltstorm pistols, meanwhile,
are ideal for firing on the move,
allowing the Rangers to provide
supporting fire for their allies while
they themselves rapidly get into
position, or to run down isolated
targets and destroy them in a
focussed volley of crackling missiles.

VANGUARD-PALLADORS

The chimeric Gryph-chargers ridden
by the Vanguard-Palladors are
mercurial creatures that surf the
magical winds. The bond between

steed and rider is not easily forged,
but once established wi l l
last a
lifetime. Sometimes, a Gryph-
charger wi l l witness a Vanguard-
Hunter fighting against impossible
odds, and dive in to fight alongside
them. Afterwards, the beast might
allow the Stormcast to cleanse its
fur and feathers of blood and dirt,
a ritual that signals the start of a
lasting relationship. At other times,
a Vanguard-Hunter wi l l follow a
prospective steed on a gruelling
hunt. At pursuit’s end, the shared ki l l
is enough for the Gryph-charger to
accept its new companion.

Battles beyond counting have been
won when all seemed lost by the
sudden arrival of a host of Vanguard-
Palladors. They are lightning-fast
shock cavalr y able to traverse entire
battlefields in the blink of an eye,
allowing them to react to the ebb
and flow of war faster than even the
Extremis Chambers. The Gryph-
chargers tear at their prey with beak
and claw, able to pierce even armour
plate, whilst their Stormcast riders
level pinpoint attacks with boltstorm
pistols and starstrike javelins. Before
the slain bodies of their foes even hit
the floor, the Vanguard-Palladors
are already on the move, seeking
fresh quarry.

Hammer of the Paladins

80

HAMMER OF THE PALADINS

The Paladin Conclaves of the Stormhosts are comprised of hulking, heavily armoured warriors that carr y long-
hafted weapons to battle – weapons that two normal men would struggle to lift. It is their duty to slay the fiercest
monsters and the most well-defended leaders – they are reforged often, for their life expectancy is short.

RETRIBUTORS

Of all the warriors of the Paladin
Conclaves,
it is perhaps the
Retributors who most closely evoke
the image of the God-King. The
sight of these heroes in battle gives
pause to even the most ancient and
malevolent of Sigmar’s foes, for
the devastation wrought by their
massive, two-handed lightning
hammers stirs in those fiends long-
forgotten memories of a bold warrior
chieftain whose fur y and nobility
were both terrible and glorious
to behold.

Such is the heft of the Retributors’
mauls that only the strongest
among the Stormcast Eternals may
wield them. These weapons were
not designed for the cut and thrust
of single combat, but to deliver a
single, earth-shaking blow that no
armour or unnatural constitution is
proof against.

Should a lightning hammer strike
true, the crackling energies bound
within its head are discharged in a
deafening thunderclap, empowering
the blow with irresistible force and
blasting the target apart in a cloud
of glowing white embers. If the
members of a Retributor retinue
focus their attacks, they can even
bring down fortifications, toppling
iron-banded watchtowers as a
woodsman fells a tree, or pounding
smoking breaches in castle walls so
that their fellows can storm inside.

Just as their own hammer-blows
require expert timing to cause
the greatest ruination,
it is not
uncommon for Retributors to be
held back from the battlefield until
the most powerful enemies have
been singled out. When it seems
as though a rampaging monster or
unstoppable siege engine is about to
crash into the Stormcasts’ ranks, the
Retributors strike from the Heavens,
their hammer-heads falling like
twin-tailed comets to smash the
threat into oblivion.

PROTECTORS

Stormcast Eternals who are chosen
to be Protectors must demonstrate
great skill at arms, cooperation
with their retinue comrades and
a keen awareness of the flow of
battle. The long-bladed stormstrike
glaives they wield are difficult
weapons to master, but can be used
both defensively and offensively to
great effect. When swung through
the air,
the ensorcelled blades of
these polearms leave a glowing
after-image in their passing. This
energy field is far from intangible,
however,
for before it dissipates it has
physicality enough to deflect enemy
projectiles mid-flight.

In the deft hands of a Protector,
a stormstrike glaive can weave a
continuous barrier of protective
force, forming a potent shield for
themselves and those behind them.
Retinues of Protectors train together
exhaustively,
for when working
in unison they can guard whole
sections of a battle-line with a screen
of repelling magic. The Protectors
of some Stormhosts, such as the
Knights Excelsior, work in perfect
synchronicity, each warrior falling
into the same pattern of sweeps and
motions that is almost machine-like
to behold. Others, like the warriors
of the Astral Templars, develop
fighting styles that, although unique
to each warrior,
interlace with a
wondrous fluidity.

The role of the Protectors is by
no means exclusively defensive,
however,
for these Paladins are
expert monster-slayers. The length
of their weapons allows them to
drive deep into a hostile beast’s hide,
piercing a vital organ or severing
an arter y in a fountain of blood
or ichor. Prosecutor-Primes are
invariably astute tacticians, and at
their signal, the entire retinue wi l l
shift stance, moving instantly from
noble guardians to vengeful doom-
bringers, the mere sight of which is
often enough to cause the foe to flee.

DECIMATORS

Where the enemy charges forth in a
dense, numberless horde, there can
be found the Decimators, plying
their bloody trade. Though these
Paladins arrive to battle as part of
a retinue, each of them knows that
they are at their deadliest with room
to swing their thunderaxes without
fear of hitting their comrades. When
battle is joined, the Decimators rely
on their exacting training in the
Gladitorium to judge the location
and actions of each of their brothers
amid the confusion of melee. It is
well that they do so, for when they
swing their weapons, not even
layered sigmarite can stop passage
of their blades. All those within
reach are cleaved in twain with
gruesome ease.

As it dawns upon the enemy
forces, hitherto confident in their
superiority of numbers, that they
are but simple fodder before these
masked giants in their midst, doubt
sinks its claws into their craven
hearts. Then, what they thought
would be an overwhelming raid
on an isolated foe turns into an
undignified rout. The Decimators
care not which way this hostile sea
flows, and their reaping strikes do
not stop until every single one of
the God-King’s enemies is added to
the mound of dismembered body
parts rapidly accumulating around
each of their positions. Only when
the battlefield is clear of foes do they
cease their onslaught.

Like their fellow Paladins, some
Decimators enter battle bearing
colossal starsoul maces. A warrior
with such a weapon need not be
concerned about striking the enemy
directly,
for wherever the heavy
flanges of the mace land, a shock
wave of celestial energy explodes
outwards that not only shatters the
bones of the foe, but blasts their very
souls out of synchronicity with their
mortal forms, slaying them as surely
as any physical death blow.

The Riders Extremis

THE RIDERS EXTREMIS

Many are the ways that the godbeast Dracothion has contributed to Sigmar’s crusade, but that alliance is
embodied most of all in the drake-riding knights of the Chambers Extremis. The combination of the sons of
Sigmar and the star-scaled beasts of the Great Drake has proven an unstoppable force upon the battlefield.

81

DRACOTHIAN GUARD

The Dracothian Guard are formed
of four distinct types of retinue
composed into two echelons.
Striking in successive waves, they hit
swiftly and hard, for every immortal
human and celestially empowered
beast is selected, equipped, and
trained for a specific battlefield role.

The fighting heart of the Extremis
Chamber is composed of the
Dracothian Guard – heavily
armoured knights mounted atop
thickly muscled reptilian beasts,
who fulfil the role of the Stormcast
Eternals’ shock cavalry. Their charge
is a battering ram, a destructive
wedge that can splinter apart enemy
armies in a wave of claws, crackling
weapons and celestial bolts.

Like the elder Stardrakes, the
Dracoths too seek to restore order.
However, Dracoths are far less
patient than their larger kin, being
much more apt to charge into battle
at the nearest opportunity. Such a
temperament is fitting, for those
Stormcasts who succeed in the Trials
of Starwa lking are also,
invariably,
the boldest and bravest of their kind.
Together,
rider and beast are eager
to seek out the foe and exact bloody
vengeance upon them.

Members of the Dracothian
Guard are divided into two forces,
known as the Lightning and
Thunderwave Echelons. Within
each echelon, two types of retinue
are deployed. The retinue to which
a Dracoth or Stormcast Eternal
is
assigned depends on their skills
and personalities.

The most aggressive of all are
destined to be Fulminators – the
tip of the spear and the first to
lead the Lightning Echelon into
combat. No matter the odds, these
individuals seek the enemy as soon
as possible, employing fluid fighting
styles to take advantage of every
opportunity. Also of the Lightning

Echelon are the Tempestors, expert
marksmen mounted upon quick-
witted Dracoths. These beasts must
manoeuvre into position while their
rider aims and fires, every movement
designed to achieve the best angles
of fire.

The first retinues of the Thunderwave
Echelon are the Concussors. Their
riders and beasts are chosen for
strength and brawling ability,
for it is
the savage shock of their attack that
sets up their allies for the ultimate
strike. Merciless are those that
follow,
for it is their duty to finish off
the foe – all of them. The Stormcast
Eternals and Dracoths that become
Desolators are uncompromising,
and utterly committed to exacting
total retribution. Theirs is the
final
judgement.

DRAKESWORN
TEMPLARS

The combination of a Stardrake – a
powerfully magical creature of
the Heavens – and one of the most
skilled fighters of the Stormcast
Eternals creates a Drakesworn
Templar. These knights of Azyr are
celestial judgement made manifest,
who exact Sigmar’s vengeance on the
deadliest enemies of Order.

A lone Drakesworn Templar can
sunder an enemy’s battle-line or
stave in an entire flank of an army.
Propelled by mighty wing-beats,
the Stardrake hurtles into the foe,
striking with impact enough to
splinter hell-forged armour. The
Stardrake’s
claws rip through steel,
raking down whole ranks of victims,
while powerful jaws deliver a bite
that can shear through a gargant’s
leg with ease. From atop his saddle,
the Stormcast Eternal swings his
lightning-wreathed weapon to
smite all about him. When all of an
Extremis Chamber’s Drakesworn
Templars ride to war, they can level
enemy strongholds or devastate
entire armies.

All those who seek to become
Drakesworn Templars attempt
the Trials of Starwalking . Many
return empty-handed, haunted by
what they have seen, but some of
the bravest encounter Dracoths
and join the Dracothian Guard. A
smaller percentage still are deemed
worthy enough to find a solargem
– the trapped soul of a Stardrake.
Before the coming of Chaos, that
star material would have returned
to the Heavens to be reincarnated
into a newly formed body. Since
the great corruption, however,
the
souls often become trapped in the
Mortal Realms. They are protected
by enchantments; only the most
noble can see a solargem, and only
those blessed with divinity can touch
such purity. Even other Stormcast
Eternals hold Drakesworn Templars
in awe, recognising them as
mystically pure champions of Order.

By returning a solargem to the
Heavens, a Stormcast Eternal forges
a bond with a child of Dracothion,
much as Sigmar and the Great
Drake did in the Age of Myth.
Stardrakes are no mere steeds of
war, but an ancient race older and
wiser than mankind. Seeing the
collapse of reason and the growing
menace of Chaos, the Stardrakes
wish to do their part to restore the
balance of Order. Thus do these
celestial creatures willing ly join
Sigmar’s crusade. After a series of
bonding rituals, Stormcast Eternal
and immortal star-beast form a
rapport where each instinctively
understands the wi l l of the other.
Together,
they seek not only revenge
for the wreckage wrought upon the
realms, but justice, for the Laws of
Judgement demand that the guilty
be tried.

When not actively campaigning, the
Templars and Stardrakes maintain
their Stormhost’s Drakesworn
Temple – the great star-dome where
those of their Extremis Chamber
train and worship together.

To Wield the Stormbolt

82

TO WIELD THE STORMBOLT

The warriors of the Corpuscant Conclaves fight with weapons bolstered or linked together with chains of
summoned power, sizzling arcs of lightning stretching and writhing between them. The combination of Heavens-
blessed weapons and crack ling storm energy makes these magically infused warriors deadly indeed.

EVOCATORS

The Corpuscant Conclaves of the
Sacrosanct Chambers are formed
of mages capable of embodying
the tempest’s energy. Rather than
unleashing it in the manner of the
Knight-Incantor,
they absorb this
energy into themselves. The eyes of
an Evocator in fu l l battle rage flash
with sparks, and veins of lightning
glow beneath his skin. That same
energy plays over his tempest blade
and stormstave as he advances,
arcing outward to ground nearby.
These bursts are deadly, and can
blacken and scorch anyone in
proximity if not consciously and
carefully channelled. However,
Evocators can also use this energy
to empower their fellow Stormcasts
with Azyrite energy.

Even should a rain of arrow shafts
fall towards the Evocators, the
projectiles are burned from the skies
by the stormbolts that arc between
their weapons. On through the
thickest fire the Evocators stride,
leaving tiny serpents of lightning
in their footprints and scattering
ash in the air. When they reach the
foe, Evocators fight in a storm of
interweaving blows that are all but
impossible to avoid. When their
tempest blades and stormstaves
strike the foe, the captive cables of
energy that link their weapons wind
around the enemy, burning them
to the bone before leaping back
to crackle between their master’s
weapons once more. Even an orruk
horde wi l l buckle under the intensity
of a massed Evocators assault.

The most battle-hungry Evocators
ride on massively built creatures
known as Celestial Dracolines. Both
saurian and feline in aspect, these
creatures hail from the high peaks
of Azyr. It is their habit to sharpen
their claws upon mineral deposits
rich in the realmstone known as
celestium. In doing so, they charge
themselves with the power of the
storm, their bodies carr ying a build-
up of magic that can be released
in a great scorching blast when
the beasts pounce upon their prey.
Combined with their heart-stopping
roar,
this makes the Dracolines
fearsome creatures indeed. A
charging Evocator and his mount
are capable of felling a mournfang
with such force its fellows wi l l flee in
primal panic.

The Shattering Strike

THE SHATTERING STRIKE

The warriors of the Ordinatos Conclaves take the role of heavy arti l ler y in the Stormhosts’ militar y operations.
Though they are most often seen defending the walls of a Stormkeep, they too can be borne to battle on pillars of
lightning, appearing in a blaze of light to open fire upon choice enemy targets.

CELESTAR BALLISTAS

The Sacristan Engineers of the
Sacrosanct Chambers hail from the
Ordinatos Conclave – sometimes
known as the Conclave of the
Thunderbolt for the devastating
impact it can have on a battle. These
warrior-engineers command the
chambers’ magical field artillery.
When a Celestar Ballista is set up to
defend a sacred site, approaching too
close can mean an explosive death.

These war machines were first
devised to defend the Anvil of the
Apotheosis from attack. Installed
by the foremost engineers of the
conclave, they were set in the high
archways that overlook Sigmar’s
palaces and the sacred halls within.
So cleverly were they designed
that they could pivot around in a
fu l l circle with ease – ostensibly
for a better field of fire should the
Sigmarabulum ever be attacked, but
also so they could be brought to bear
against any aetheric apparition that
broke free from the Anvil over the
course of a traumatic reforging.

The Celestar Ballista is constructed
in such a way that it can be broken
down and carried by the two
Sacristan Engineers that operate
it, for the Stormcast Eternals are
first and foremost a mobile force. In
practice, it is more often utilised as
a defence asset, coveted by Lord-
Arcanums and Lord-Celestants
alike. Wherever such a war machine
is set, its versatility and impressive
rate of fire allows it to dominate the
battlefield, and when focused on a

single target,
its accuracy and power
can deal a grievous blow to even a
greater daemon of the Dark Gods.

Even without any enchantment, the
sigmarite bolts flung from a Ballista’s
firing apparatus could punch
through a raised oaken drawbridge.
Yet
the Sacristan Engineers have
their own method of using celestial
magic. By taking each bolt to the top
of the Sigmarabulum’s
spires, they
use their magical talents to coax
coils of stray lightning down into
the rune-inscribed projectiles. The
risks inherent in this arcane process
have led to more than one premature
reforging, but this is considered a
worthwhile sacrifice. Once a bolt has
been fully charged in this manner,
it
becomes blisteringly hot, and it can
induce star-given visions in those
who touch it with their bare skin –
not for nothing do the Sacristans
wear heavy forge gauntlets as they go
about their work. The better to keep
this valuable asset safe, the bolt is
stored in a special cartridge until it
is time for its power to be unleashed.
In the midst of battle, these bolts
are then loaded into their ballistas
and shot like streaks of blue-white
energy at the foe. Should their strike
be true, they wi l l blast right through
the target in a chain explosion of
arcane force.

‘The lords of Chaos

long sought

to break

down the Gates of Azyr,

to crack open

Almighty Sigmar’s defences and seize

the magic of

the Heavens

for their own.

Some still do,

fools that

they are.

We of

the Sacrosanct Chambers

shall

bring the storm’s energ y to them, and in

great measure.

In their

last moments,

when they are little more than screaming

corpse-things,

they may realise it

is not

to their

taste.’

- Dontran, Sacristan Engineer

THE FAITHFUL
BEASTS OF AZYR

The creatures that aid the
Stormcast Eternals in their
quest to destroy Chaos are
not all riding beasts. The
smaller, more agile creatures
that fight alongside them are
no less stalwart of heart, and
together form a vital part of the
Stormhost’s fighting machine.

Though often the boon
companions of Lord-
Castellants and Lord-Veritants,
Gryph-hounds also stalk the
battlefield alone and in packs.
These nimble quadrupeds
have senses as sharp as their
retractable claws and heavy,
hooked beaks. They are noble
creatures possessed of an
innate hatred of Chaos, and
wi l l ferociously attack on sight
anything or anyone tainted
by the Dark Gods. Such a
temperament makes them
natural companions of the
Stormcast Eternals, and useful
assets when rooting out the
more clandestine servants
of the Ruinous Powers. The
colouration of Gryph-hounds
varies greatly,
from dun browns
to electric blues, though
members of any given pack
usually display some variation
of the same hues and markings.

Aetherwings, those avian
celestial hunters that fight
alongside Vanguard-Raptors,
are far more enigmatic –
but they fight just as hard,
especially when their masters
are threatened. It is the likeness
of the Aetherwing that is
borne atop the mask of that
mysterious order,
for they seek
to emulate the uncannily sharp
vision and pinpoint accuracy
of their totem familiar birds
whenever they are on the hunt.

Marks of the Righteous

84

MARKS OF THE RIGHTEOUS

The war panoply of the Stormhosts is replete with iconography, each sculpted armour plate or sigil-emblazoned
shield carr y ing a message that speaks of the wearer’s valour and allegiance. Though common themes recur, the
heraldr y of Sigmar is seen in a thousand variations across the realms.

ICONS

The icon borne on a Stormcast’s
left shoulder denotes their role. The twin-
tailed comet identifies the Angelos Conclaves, the star the Justicar Conclaves,
and the lightning bolt the Redeemer Conclaves. The crescent moon – worn on
the right shoulder – is for the Paladin Conclaves. Warriors of the Sacrosanct
Chambers bear their own markings; a blaze of arcane fire represents the
Corpuscant Conclaves, and a cog symbol the Ordinatos Conclaves.

SHIELDS

All the Stormhosts of the First
Striking bear the icon of a sacred
hammer. Later strikings might use
the icons of the twin-tailed comet,
referring to how Sigmar entered
Azyr ; the eclipse, representing the
light of Sigmar’s salvation emerging
from the shadow ; or the wielded
hammer, representing the Warrior
Defiant. Their exact colours var y
from Stormhost to Stormhost.

CHAMBER DESIGNATION

Many Stormhosts identify their chambers by the colours of
their plumes or crests. Each type of retinue has a distinct
helm design. The chamber’s colour is picked by their
Lord-Celestant;
for example the Hammerhands display red
plumes, echoing that worn by Lord Vandus Hammerhand.

TABARDS

Within each conclave can be found a number of different
retinues. Each retinue within a conclave is identified by the
colour of the tabard’s
trim; there can be up to three retinues
with the same identifying colour. In this case, each is
further distinguished by the colour of their buckles – gold,
silver, or bronze.

THE BEASTMARKS

To display the likeness of an Azyrite beast is a
mark of honour,
testifying to a quality or aspect of
the wearer – the might of a cave bear, the swiftness
of a Star-eagle, or the ferocity of a celestial lion.
These adornments are usually worn by officers,
such as the primes of each Stormcast retinue.

HAMMERS OF SIGMAR

As the first Stormhost to be
founded, the Hammers of Sigmar
are exemplars in their rigid militar y
order and use of heraldic insignia.

HALLOWED KNIGHTS

The Hallowed Knights are zealously
faithful. The ranks of these crusaders
include shining saints and mar tyrs
that radiate the silvery light of purity.

CELESTIAL VINDICATORS

Stern and single-minded are the
warriors of the sixth Stormhost. To
see them fight is to witness a fierce
hurricane of razored blades.

ANVILS OF THE
HELDENHAMMER

Though the Anvils hail from elder
days, this anachronism lends them
new insights into life and death.

THE SIGMARITE
BROTHERHOOD

Recruited from the metallic lands of
Chamon, this Stormhost is known
for its ever-advancing shield walls.

KNIGHTS EXCELSIOR

The battlefields in the wake of the

THE LIONS OF SIGMAR

Little is known of the Lions of
Sigmar, save that the thunderous
roar of their battle-cry has preceded
many a victory over Chaos forces.

ASTRAL TEMPLARS

The Astral Templars are often called
barbaric by the other Stormhosts, for
they love the wild hunt above all, and
stalk monsters with a feral intensity.

BLADES OF DAWN

The Blades of Dawn are a proud
Stormhost. They hail from coastal
tribes across the realms, and have
proved to be expert seafarers.

masters of the rapid assault.

LIGHTNING HAWKS

Named after a fierce raptor of Azyr,
the Lightning Hawks strike out of
the skies without warning. They are
the scourge of the unholy.

CELESTIAL
WARBRINGERS

The Celestial Warbringers are
warrior seers, and claim to each
know the hour of their death.

FISTS OF SIGMARITE

None can best the Fists of Sigmarite
for boldness and surety. They hope to
be first in glory, eclipsing all others
as the war against Chaos rages on.

THE GHYRAN GUARD

Formed of a single tribe of warriors
that are the last of their kind, the
Ghyran Guard have an especial
hatred for the minions of Nurgle.

CELESTIAL KNIGHTS

In battle, the Radiant Suns of Sigmar
gleam with the brilliance of Sigendil.
Theirs is the purity of the righteous.

THE CRIMSON SERAPHS

The soothsayer rites of the Crimson
Seraphs are bloody, yet effective.
Their mastery of omens sees them
strike with great prescience.

THE SILENT HOST

Whether this Stormhost keeps silent
by choice, or through an accident of
reforging, none truly knows – but
their actions speak for themselves.

THE BLOODED DAWN

Comprised solely of those who
have fought Chaos since they were
children, the Blooded Dawn are
single-minded, and deadly indeed.

AZYRITE ARBITERS

The Azyrite Arbiters are obsessed
with justice. They would see bloody
retribution delivered to every Chaos
worshipper in the realms.

STORMBLOOD GUARD

The veteran warriors of the
Stormblood Guard are said to bleed
lightning. If wounded, they become

CELESTIAL SPLENDOUR

104

CELESTIAL SPLENDOUR

Stormcast Eternals can be gathered into martial formations of many kinds, with large conclaves and smaller
strike forces known as brotherhoods being amongst the most common. There are many ways to collect a Stormcast
force, and this spread offers one example of how an army of Sigmar can be amassed for war.

When collecting a Warhammer Age
of Sigmar army,
it’s a good idea to
have a plan. How you decide which
units to include in your Stormcast
Eternals army might be based on the
look of the models, how you envision
them performing during a tabletop
battle, or could follow a narrative
found in a battletome or even one
of your own invention. There is no
single right way to collect your army,
only the way you deem best. The goal
is the same – to field a battle-ready
force of Stormcast Eternals ready for
action! Here is how we assembled the
collection shown below.

The leader of this army is Aventis
Firestrike, who was chosen for two
main reasons. First, we love the
majestic pose of this centrepiece
model. Secondly, he is a powerful
leader that can hurl deadly spells
and bolster the abilities of the rest of
the army. When combined with the
meteoric charge of his steed Loithar,
his abilities make him a formidable
opponent for whatever enemy leaders
he may come up against.

The Knights-Incantor give the
army two additional strong magical
presences – with one using the Lore

of Invigoration and the other using
the Lore of the Storm, they can
support their kindred whilst blasting
apart the smaller units of the enemy.

The core of this army is comprised of
two units of Liberators – these form
the army’s ‘anvil’. They can absorb
damage dealt out by the foe while
the army’s more aggressive troops
deliver the hammer blow elsewhere.
With the Judicators and Castigators
behind them, they can also anchor
the brotherhood’s firebase, ensuring
these ranged troops are able to take
their maximum toll.


PAGEBREAK
105

The winged Prosecutors in this force
are fast-moving flying units, and
they too pack a punch. They excel
at swiftly claiming objectives, and
also harr ying and destroying enemy
flanking units – as well as those
heroes foolish enough to stray into
their sights.

This army’s already formidable
shooting power is taken to the
next level with the inclusion of the
Hailstorm Battery. The Celestar
Ballista provides the army with
serious ar ti l ler y support while their
Castigator kinsmen rain magical
firepower upon those that get too
close. Guided by the Lord-Ordinator,
these devastating units can cut
down the opponent’s
leaders and
behemoths through weight of
firepower alone, changing the course
of a battle in moments.

The Cleansing Phalanx is the final
piece of the puzzle. This was included
not only because we love the sight
of massed units of Evocators on
Dracolines, but also because these
units are fully capable of going
toe-to-toe with elite enemy units.
Their charge, when empowered
with the magic of the Evocators
and the Knight-Incantor, can tear
out the heart of the foe in a single
devastating round. The Sequitors,
along with the rest of the line
infantry, wi l l take down any units
that escape that deadly onslaught.

As a whole, this brotherhood of
Stormcast Eternals presents a
collector and painter with a great
variety of hard-hitting, heavily
armoured troops, as well as a
competitive tabletop force with
many exciting gaming options.

PAINTING YOUR STORMCAST ETERNALS

PAINTING YOUR
STORMCAST ETERNALS

Whether you have never painted a Citadel Miniature in your life or are a master of the brush with decades of
experience, the prospect of painting a Stormcast Eternals army offers an exciting challenge. On the following
pages you w i l l find stage-by-stage guides to get you started, with tips and examples from the experts.

There is nothing like the sight of
a fully painted army of Citadel
Miniatures. There is real satisfaction
to be had in adding colour to your
collection, teasing out the finely
sculpted details, making your
miniatures your own, and creating a
unified force. After all, one painted
model looks great, but an entire
army brought together through
shared colours, iconography and
heraldry is even more fantastic.
There is also immense gratification
in watching your collection grow as
you add each new painted figure to
the ranks of the finished models.

There’s no right or wrong way to go
about painting your collection of
miniatures. Some people revel in
treating each miniature as a work
of art,
lavishing attention on every
millimetre of every model and
painstaking ly crafting scenic bases.
Others prefer a far simpler approach
with basic but consistent paint jobs

that allow them to quickly complete
legions of finished warriors. And,
of course, there is plenty of middle
ground for those that enjoy painting
their troops but want to devote
special attention to key figures
such as heroes, war machines and
monsters. Again, there is no one way
to paint,
just the way that works best
for you. In the end, the goal is to field
a fully painted force of Stormcast
Eternals on the tabletop – and with
many heroic and statuesque warriors
in its midst, replete with gleaming
raiments of war, a Stormcast Eternals
army can be truly awe-inspiring.

Before painting your models, you’ ll
first need to assemble them. To begin
with, we recommend you follow the
advice given in the construction
booklet provided with your models,
but as your confidence grows
you may want to customise your
miniatures by combining different
weapons and modifying their poses.

Base paints contain a high percentage of pigment, and
deliver bold, intense colour that provides the foundation for
the paint scheme. Neat basecoats are key to a great-looking
miniature, and two thin coats are almost always better than
one thick coat.

Shade paints are almost the consistency of ink, and are
designed to run into the model’s recesses to create depth and
contrast. They are usually applied all over an area as a wash,
or painted directly into recesses such as the gaps between
armour plates.

Dry paints are applied using a technique called dr ybrushing,
which involves passing a very lightly loaded brush rapidly
across the model to apply a dusting of colour to the raised
details. It’s a very quick way of adding highlights to
a miniature.

Layer paints are brighter colours than Base paints, and have
a smoother consistency. They are usually applied all over
an underlying Base colour to achieve a more vibrant hue,
or are painted in focused lines along raised areas and edges
as highlights.

Next, you can choose a paint
scheme. Many of the most famous
Stormhosts are shown on the
following pages and in the art
throughout this book, but of course
it is also possible to create your own.
Which Stormhost you choose can
influence the character of your army
as well as its abilities (see page 117).

The Citadel Paint System takes the
guesswork out of painting, and
uses several different formulations
of paint to best match different
techniques. The paints are used in
a set sequence, and each enhances
the underlying colour to produce a
spectacular finished effect. Once you
have grasped the basic techniques,
you wi l l find such results are well
within reach.

The first paint you’ ll apply is called
the undercoat. Supplied in spray
cans,
it’s formulated to provide a
smooth, even surface for the colours
that follow. Once it has dried, you
can break out your brushes and
start bringing your miniature to life.
The following stage-by-stage guides
present the colours and techniques
we used to paint the Stormhosts, but
there are no ‘rules’ as to the colours
you can use for your own miniatures
– the Mortal Realms are a limitless
canvas; so it’s entirely up to you.

Warhammer TV’s painting
tutorials have insights for
everyone, as they show you how
to paint Citadel Miniatures
from start to finish. The
guides are available for free
on games-workshop.com, and
can also be watched via the
Warhammer TV YouTube
channel. Why not take a

Painting Features

PAINTING FEATURES

The basics of painting Stormcast Eternals are many and varied depending on the Stormhost you have chosen –
these are detailed on the following pages. However, there w i l l be elements in common no matter which Stormhost
you choose. Here are a few helpful tips for features that w i l l recur in most paint schemes.

WEAPON EFFECTS

107

Use Lahmian Medium to
thin Temple Guard Blue to
create a glowing effect on
details like this star.

Apply a glaze of Guilliman
Blue over Runefang Steel,
then touch up the edges
with Runefang Steel.

Use a Celestra Grey base,
alternating patches of
Coelia Greenshade, then
highlights of White Scar.

Apply Thousand Sons Blue
to create lightning, then
thin lines of Temple Guard
Blue and White Scar.

FUR CLOAKS

Over a base of Abaddon
Black, carefully drybrush
Dark Reaper, then
Administratum Grey.

Use an XV88 base with
Agrax Earthshade.
Drybrush Balor Brown
and Screaming Skull.

Apply a Zandri Dust base.
Layer Ushabti Bone with a
shade of Seraphim Sepia.
Drybrush Wrack White.

Use Gorthor Brown, then
Karak Stone in the middle,
add a Rhinox Hide pattern,
and then Longbeard Grey.

PHIALS, GLASS AND GEM-LIKE ARTEFACTS

VARNISH TIPS

Use ’Ardcoat as a
glossy varnish – but
remember to only
apply it to the glassy or
gemstone-like textures
rather than the metallic
parts that surround
them. This gives a
glass-like sheen.

Paint a Russ Grey base
with Nuln Oil. Add edge
highlights of Fenrisian
Grey and Ulthuan Grey.

SHIELD DESIGNS

Use a Celestra Grey base
with Guilliman Blue glaze.
Pick out the edges with
Ulthuan Grey highlights.

Apply an Abaddon Black
base, then Mephiston Red.
Use Trollslayer and Yriel
Yellow edge highlights.

Pick points at the top and
bottom, then lightly trace
lines using a pencil to
create your design.

This design was filled with
Mephiston Red. Make sure
to cover over the pencil
lines carefully.

This chevron design
represents the twin-
tailed comet, icon of the
God-King Sigmar.

Shield patterns are
symbolic. Red can
represent blood, and blue
the Realm of Heavens.


PAGEBREAK
PLUMES

FACES

108

Apply Mephiston Red,
a Nuln Oil shade, then
drybrush Evil Sunz Scarlet
and Fire Dragon Bright.

Use a Screamer Pink base,
Nuln Oil shade, then Pink
Horror and Emperor’s
Children edge highlights.

Use Kislev Flesh, Reikland
Fleshshade, Kislev Flesh
to tidy up, and then Flayed
One Flesh to highlight.

Use Rhinox Hide, then a
Doombull Brown layer,
Tuskgor Fur and Cadian
Fleshtone highlights.

PROSECUTOR WINGS

1

2

3

Apply a Celestra Grey basecoat to the
wing rays, being careful not to stray
onto the finished armoured areas.

Then apply a one-to-one mix of
Drakenhof Nightshade and Lahmian
Medium. This creates a more
translucent coat that is easier to layer
over, and gives a radiant glow effect.

Layer the wing rays with Ulthuan
Grey, being careful not to get any
paint in the recesses. Brush along
each ridge to get a nice clean finish.

BEAST FLESH

Use a Jokaero Orange base, followed
by a layer of Tau Light Ochre, then
Reikland Fleshshade in the recesses,
followed by an edge highlight of
Screaming Skull.

Apply a coat of Incubi Darkness,
then Kabalite Green,
leaving the
basecoat visible in the recesses.

Apply Kabalite Green,
Abaddon Black and

For the beak, apply
XV88, Agrax Earthshade,
Tau Light Ochre and
Screaming Skull.

For the eye, base Abaddon

SCALES

PATTERNS

Use an Incubi Darkness
base, then Dawnstone
and Administratum Grey
edge highlights.

Use Stegadon Scale Green,
Coelia Greenshade, then
Sotek Green and Temple
Guard Blue highlights.

Plan your pattern out
on a piece of paper first.
Use inspiration from the
natural world to design it.

Carefully apply the paints
in multiple thin layers,
tidying up with the
basecoat if you need to.

MARKS OF BATTLE

For a distressed and battle-
scarred appearance on
lighter armour, first use
a contrasting Layer paint
to create the shape of the
mark. Inside this apply
a small inset of darker
paint to create the effect of
an indentation.

For a similar effect on
darker armour, use lighter
Layer paints one after
another to create thin
lines. These give the effect
of scratch marks upon the
armour. For example, use
Dark Reaper followed by
Fenrisian Grey.

To create a war paint
design like this stylised
claw mark, first carefully
apply Calgar Blue in
three parallel
lines that
taper at each end, then
highlight these with flesh
highlight colours to create
a natural finish.

To replicate battlefield
mud, blend dark brown
and light brown paints
using a stippling technique
and an M Dry brush. For
blood and gore, apply
splatter marks of Blood for
the Blood God to armour
and robes.

OTHER STORMHOSTS

Many of the Stormhosts featured in this book – and likely many of your own invention – w i l l have colours in
common with those depicted in the painting guides in this section. By simply adjusting a few of the colours and
mixing and matching techniques you can find painting solutions for hundreds of other Stormhosts.

ASTRAL TEMPLARS

KNIGHTS OF AZYR

•

You can paint the Astral Templars using the Celestial Warbringers
painting guide on pages 112-113, but change the inlay of the pauldron
and the flat of the shield to a Screamer Pink base with a Nuln Oil
wash. Then use Screamer Pink to tidy the model up and give a thicker
edge highlight, then apply thinner edge highlights of Pink Horror and
Emperor’s Children.

•

Paint
the tassets Abaddon Black, with a thick Dark Reaper edge highlight,
then thinner edge highlights of Thunderhawk Blue and Fenrisian Grey.

• Use the standard Stormcast Eternals shields to mark your model as an
Astral Templar. As Astral Templars are more savage than most, it would
be appropriate to use pelts, furs and bare heads for this Stormhost. They
might also have battle damage such as claw scars and tooth marks.

•

You can paint the Knights of Azyr using the Tempest Lords painting
guide above, but use Calgar Blue instead of Lothern Blue for the final
edge highlight.

Paint
the tassets Khorne Red, with a Nuln Oil wash. Then use Evil Sunz
Scarlet for the first edge highlight and Fire Dragon Bright for the second.

Paint
the trim on the pauldrons and the inner part of the tabard with a
base of Retributor Gold and a shade of Reikland Fleshshade. Then use
a layer of Auric Armour Gold, and a final edge highlight of Stormhost
Silver. For tabard’s
trim, use Ushabti Bone with a Seraphim Sepia wash.
Then add edge highlights of Screaming Skull and Pallid Wych Flesh.

FISTS OF SIGMARITE

KNIGHTS OF THE AURORA

You can paint the Fists of Sigmarite using the Hammers of Sigmar
painting guide on pages 110-111, but change the pauldron inlay and flat of
the shield from Kantor Blue to Abaddon Black, highlighting the black with
Mechanicus Standard Grey and Administratum Grey.

Paint
the tabard trim with Stegadon Scale Green, then highlight with
Sotek Green and Temple Guard Blue.

• The shield on this Liberator is from the Celestial Warbringers Upgrades
kit, but painted with the same colour scheme as the rest of the model.

Paint
the gold using the Hammers of Sigmar guide on pages 110-111. For

edge highlight.

For the silver armour, use a Leadbelcher base, then a Coelia Greenshade
shade. Then use an Ironbreaker layer highlight and a Runefang Steel

Fleshtone for the final edge highlight.

SCIONS OF THE STORM

Sigmar’s finest warriors strike as if from nowhere, the
building storm heralding their arrival.

STORMHOSTS

The Stormhosts of Azyr are numerous, and each one
has its own methods of waging war.

Instead of setting up a STORMCAST ETERNAL unit
on the battlefield, you can place it to one side and say
that it is set up in the Celestial Realm as a reserve unit.
You can set up one reserve unit in the Celestial Realm
for each unit you have set up on the battlefield. At the
end of your movement phase, you can set up one or
more of the reserve units in the Celestial Realm on the
battlefield, more than 9" from any enemy units. Any
reserve units in the Celestial Realm that are not set up
on the battlefield before the start of the fourth battle
round are slain.

SHOCK AND AWE

When the Stormcast Eternals arrive to reinforce their
allies, their sudden appearance strikes terror into the
hear ts of the enemies of Sigmar.

Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks that target friendly
STORMCAST ETERNAL units that were set up on the
battlefield during the same turn.

If your army is a Stormcast Eternals army, you can give
it a Stormhost keyword. A l l STORMCAST ETERNAL
units in your army gain that keyword. If a model
already has a Stormhost keyword,
it cannot gain
another one, but this does not prevent other units in
your army from having a different Stormhost keyword.
You can either choose one of the Stormhosts listed
below, or choose another Stormhost you’ve read about
or created yourself. If you choose one from the list
below, all units with that keyword benefit from the
extra abilities listed for that Stormhost on the page
indicated. If you choose a different Stormhost, simply
pick the Stormhost that most closely matches the
nature of your own Stormhost.

Hammers of Sigmar

126

HAMMERS OF SIGMAR

The Hammers of Sigmar are the exemplars of Sigmar’s hosts, the tip of the divine stormbolt. When the God-King
wages his wars, these golden warriors lead the way, committing ever ything they have in the name of victory – for
they cannot be seen to fail.

The Hammers of Sigmar have become veterans in
the God-King’s war against darkness, and they fear
nothing – nothing, that is, except the shadow of their
own fallibility. The first of the Stormhosts to be sent into
the Mortal Realms after the Long Wait,
their victories
are many and storied, but each has been hard-won. Tens
of thousands of them have died over the years, only
to be reforged and hurled straight back into the fray –
sometimes even fighting as reinforcements in the closing
stages of the wars that claimed their lives in the first
place. Some have been remade so many times they are
losing that which once defined them, and becoming more
like living weapons than men and women.

The long years of constant war have taken their toll,
but have also honed the Hammers of Sigmar into a
formidable fighting force. Their Redeemer Conclaves are
so numerous that even should one be destroyed, another
can instantly take its place, striking down from the
Heavens in the blink of an eye. Armed with the famed
God-forged Blade, the chamber’s greatest champion is
all but unstoppable – and, inspired by the war-cries of
their leader, all the warriors of the Hammers of Sigmar
fight on even through crippling injuries. United on the
battlefield, the Hammers of Sigmar rarely baulk, even
when faced with terrifying opponents – to them, failure
is the only enemy to be feared.

ABILITIES
First to be Forged: The Hammers of Sigmar were at
the forefront of Sigmar’s war against Chaos, and have
stared down the greatest of horrors .

Add 1 to the Bravery characteristic of friendly

HAMMERS OF SIGMAR units.

COMMAND ABILITY
Soul of the Stormhost: The Redeemers of the Hammers
of Sigmar break the enemy force with waves of

If you do so, roll a dice. On a 5+ a new unit identical to
the one that was destroyed is added to your army. Set
up the new unit anywhere on the battlefield, more than
9" from any enemy models.

COMMAND TRAIT

A HAMMERS OF SIGMAR general must have this
command trait instead of one listed on page 118.

We Cannot Fail: The Hammers of Sigmar refuse to fall
until their task is completed.

Roll a dice each time you allocate a wound or mortal
wound to a friendly HAMMERS OF SIGMAR unit
wholly within 9" of this general. On a 6+, that wound
or mortal wound is negated.

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first HAMMERS OF SIGMAR HERO to receive an

God-forged Blade: Wrought by Grungni himself
for the first Stormhost, this weapon strikes with

forged Blade is 6, add 1 to the Damage characteristic of

Hallowed Knights

HALLOWED KNIGHTS

The Hallowed Knights are driven by a fierce inner fire, all doubts and negativity made distant memories by the
power of their faith. They are devoted believers, never ceasing in their crusade – even when it takes them to the
most forsaken places in all the realms. Who can triumph over the darkness? Only the faithful!

127

Guardians and spiritual protectors of the Free Peoples,
the Hallowed Knights are never idle in their constant
crusade to prove the supremacy of Sigmar. They wi l l
plunge into nightmarish war zones without hesitation,
advance at a run towards the most terrifying monsters
and daemons, and brave the deadliest environments to
deliver Sigmar’s justice, from fields of sulphurous hellfire
to the quagmires of Nurgle’s Garden.

The sheer strength of their belief in the God-King lends
the Hallowed Knights a spiritual shield against evil
magic. Though few outside their Sacrosanct Chamber are
trained in the mystical arts, their steel souls are fortified
against arcane corruption much as their sigmarite
plate protects them from the axes and blades of more
mundane enemies.

The Hallowed Knights take a humble pride in proving
their purity, seeing it as their defining quality. Those who
die time and time again in Sigmar’s service are often
gifted with sacred honour parchments so that they might
draw strength from the holy writ emblazoned there.

The leaders of the Knights, well-used to suffering in the
name of Sigmar, can summon reserves of energy even
when they are so wounded it seems that all that is left for
them is a martyr’s death.

ABILITIES
Only the Faithful: The Hallowed Knights are so devout
that they can deny even the magic of the realms.

COMMAND TRAIT

A HALLOWED KNIGHTS general must have this

holy retribution to the enemies of the God-King .

KNIGHTS unit wholly within 9" of a friendly

HALLOWED KNIGHTS HERO, or wholly within 18"
of a friendly HALLOWED KNIGHTS HERO that is a

general. Add 1 to run rolls and charge rolls for that
unit until your next hero phase. In addition, until your
next hero phase, that unit can run and still charge later
in the same turn.

Martyr’s Strength: The Hallowed Knights will not fall
until their foe is slain.

Roll a dice if this general is slain in the combat phase.
On a 2+ this general can make a pile-in move and then
attack with all of the melee weapons it is armed with,
before it is removed from play.

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first HALLOWED KNIGHTS HERO to receive

CELESTIAL VINDICATORS

The Celestial Vindicators live to slaughter those who worship Chaos. Be their foes human, skaven, beastman or
daemon, they must be met with rage, hacked to pieces so the realms might be free of their curse. In battle this
Stormhost is a hurricane of blades that never relents, and at times can even rage too hard for mortal tolerance.

Celestial
Vindicators

Some amongst the Stormcast Eternals have given
themselves over to battle-lust,
leaving behind their
former principles and priorities to embrace righteous
anger. They believe that in that rage alone can be found
the bitter strength they need to overcome their enemies.
Even their most prized weapons are empowered by
raw hatred. Without
it, they cannot hope to achieve
the monumental task ahead of them, for the realms are
functionally infinite, and a slow, deliberate strategy can
never prevail against such reckless hate. Instead they seek
to become the storm, swift and devastating, cutting down
ever ything before them, then moving on to level their
righteous hatred against the next enemy, and the next.

Even death cannot stop them, for those slain on the
battlefield are soon reforged, becoming ever more like
a force of nature as they seek to weaponise the tragic
pasts that nearly broke their minds. Every Celestial
Vindicator has a dark history that acts as the engine
driving his single-minded machine of war. The intensity
of their ire is such that it can only be calmed by repetitive
chanting and the singing of battle mantras – it is when
the Celestial Vindicators fall silent that the enemy should
fear them most. When unleashed in full, this vengeful
Stormhost can destroy ever ything in its path, levelling
the dreadholds and citadels of Chaos just as a typhoon
flattens a village.

ABILITIES
Driven by Vengeance: The Celestial Vindicators
down their foes with a flurry of blows .

friendly CELESTIAL VINDICATORS HERO, or wholly

within 18" of a friendly CELESTIAL VINDICATORS

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first CELESTIAL VINDICATORS HERO to receive an

Anvils of the
Heldenhammer

ANVILS OF THE HELDENHAMMER

The Anvils of the Heldenhammer are heroes from ages long past, summoned from their tombs by the God-King
and remade as warriors eternal. Though they fight as an ordered militar y machine, and though they do Sigmar’s
holy work, to a casual observer these ageless warriors seem like grim revenants just as terrifying as any wight.

129

Every one of the Anvils of the Heldenhammer was long
dead before they were reforged, their mortal remains
buried and rotted away. They were not taken by Sigmar
from death’s
threshold as most other Stormcasts are, but
summoned from their sepulchral rest to the God-King’s
forge. They have a complex relationship with death, for
they were denizens of Shyish before Azyr, and they know
well the slow-burning bitterness of Nagash. But knowing
that they now cannot truly die again, the warriors of this
Stormhost seek to own death, just as the eagle owns the
sky and the shark owns the deep sea. However,
that claim
does not go uncontested.

The Anvils are morbid and forbidding, their aura
unsettling even to the veterans of the Free Peoples. They
fight with tactics perfected long millennia ago, and they
do not fear death – instead seeking to embody it. Death
is the tool of every true warrior, no matter whether he
uses a soul-rending relic blade or a simple dagger. Those
of this host that have been reforged many times take on
the sinister aspect of a corpse, their skin becoming waxy
and pale, and their words little more than dr y whispers
or grave-cold, sonorous intonations. The leaders of the
Anvils of the Heldenhammer use their fearful aura to
their advantage, donning skull masks, painting their
armour with macabre imagery, or removing their helms
to reveal the cold, haunted visage beneath.

ABILITIES
No True Death: The Anvils of the Heldenhammer
know that if slain, they will return to fight again .

You can re-roll failed battleshock tests for friendly

ANVILS OF THE HELDENHAMMER units.

COMMAND ABILITY

Heroes of Another Age: The Anvils of the

Heldenhammer use ancient and revered codes of battle.

You can use this command ability in your hero

THE HELDENHAMMER unit wholly within 9" of a

friendly ANVILS OF THE HELDENHAMMER HERO,

or wholly within 18" of a friendly ANVILS OF THE
HELDENHAMMER HERO that is a general. That unit
can attack with all of the missile weapons it is armed
with, or make a pile-in move and attack with all of the
melee weapons it is armed with.

COMMAND TRAIT

An ANVILS OF THE HELDENHAMMER general must

have this command trait instead of one listed on

KNIGHTS EXCELSIOR

The Knights Excelsior are Sigmar’s divine annihilators. They see all beings as either good or evil – and it is their
duty to eliminate evil. Unfettered by doubt or indecision, they deliver the God-King’s justice to any that betray
even the slightest impurity – be it through words, deeds or merely a stray thought.

Knights Excelsior

It is said that wherever the Knights Excelsior strike, only
blackened earth is left behind. Stone is shattered, wood
is splintered, sand is turned to jagged glass by the sheer
intensity of their attack – but, most importantly, every
living creature bearing the taint of Chaos is destroyed.
They go about the delivery of this justice with a merciless
and cold detachment, not a single eye twitch spared for
those they cut down so efficiently – for they care no more
about their enemies than an exterminator cares for the
vermin he impales on his spear. Each step on the path
towards the obliteration of Chaos drives them further on
their journey. Should a brotherhood of Knights Excelsior
deal the final blow to a pack of mutants or a warband
of horned reavers, they wi l l be spurred on to deliver yet
more punishment to any who remain. The leaders of
each enemy army are priority targets for the Knights
Excelsior,
for they know the cull wi l l go all the faster if
the enemy’s rallying points are removed. This extends
even to their operations within the cities of Sigmar – the
Lord-Veritants of this Stormhost are active in Excelsis
and beyond in their tireless search for those who would
spread corruption. Those who are deemed more useful to
the war effort alive rather than dead are bound in chains
of crackling white lightning and hauled back to the
Stormkeep’s dungeons, there to meet an excruciating end
after their secrets have been extracted.

ABILITIES
Storm of Annihilation: The Knights Excelsior take a
cold pleasure in the deaths of their foes.

If a friendly KNIGHTS EXCELSIOR unit makes an
attack that destroys an enemy unit, you can re-roll
hit rolls of 1 for attacks made by that KNIGHTS
EXCELSIOR unit for the rest of the battle.

COMMAND ABILITY
No Mercy : The Knights Excelsior are merciless in
prosecuting the enemies of the God-King.

You can use this command ability in your hero phase.
If you do so, pick a friendly KNIGHTS EXCELSIOR unit
wholly within 9" of a friendly KNIGHTS EXCELSIOR
HERO, or wholly within 18" of a friendly KNIGHTS
EXCELSIOR HERO that is a general. You can re-roll
wound rolls of 1 for attacks made by that unit until the
end of the turn.

COMMAND TRAIT

A KNIGHTS EXCELSIOR general must have this

Divine Executioner : Knights Excelsior commanders

Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of this general’s melee

Celestial Lightning.

Chains of Celestial L ightning: These enchanted chains

can trap the unworthy in unbreakable bindings.

Once per battle,
in your hero phase, the bearer can
attempt to bind an enemy HERO or MONSTER model
within 3". If they do so, roll 3D6. Your opponent rolls
2D6 if the target is a HERO or 3D6 if it is a MONSTER
or HERO MONSTER . If your roll is higher, until your

Celestial
Warbringers

CELESTIAL WARBRINGERS

The warrior-seers of the Celestial Warbringers hail from a tribe of people who can foresee their own deaths. They
are touched by mysticism, and read the omens and portents of the Heavens to give them a vital edge in battle. They
use daring ploys and harness the energies of Azyr to confound and destroy those that would defy Sigmar.

131

More than any other Stormhost, the Celestial
Warbringers go to war with the blessing of the Heavens
above. They take a bellicose joy in their role as one of
Sigmar’s storm-blessed hosts, for they believe that,
with the fates aligned in their favour and the ability to
return to life even after being slain, they are essentially
invulnerable until the day of their last, true death. The
surety this engenders makes them audacious on the
battlefield, willing to take risks and gamble with their
lives in a fashion that a more conservative Stormhost
would never dream of doing. But these are no idle
gambits – each comes from careful study of prophecies
and astral alignments, the better to avoid disaster and
find the optimum time to strike. And when they strike,
they do so with the wrath of the God-King.

With so many of their number naturally adept in the
mystical arts, the Celestial Warbringers boast formidable
Sacrosanct Chambers. Their visionaries and wizards
consult enchanted orreries, astral diagrams and arcane
observatoriums on a daily basis, guiding their leaders
and champions on the battlefield as well as in matters of
state. The enchanted relics the champions of the Celestial
Warbringers bear to battle tend to be more esoteric than
those borne by other Stormhosts. Some have no physical
form at all, being weapons of the mind, but nonetheless
wi l l strike with deadly impact.

ABILITIES
Fearless Foresight: The Celestial Warbringers use
por tents to inform their strategies in battle .

COMMAND TRAIT

A CELESTIAL WARBRINGERS general must have this
command trait instead of one listed on page 118.

At the start of the first battle round, after determining
who has the first turn but before the first turn
begins, you can pick up to D3 friendly CELESTIAL
WARBRINGERS units and set them up again (any
restrictions in the set-up instructions for the battleplan
being used still apply).

Portents and Omens: The leaders of the Celestial
Warbringers
receive guidance from the stars.

Once per turn, you can re-roll 1 failed hit roll or 1
failed wound roll for an attack made by this general, or
1 failed save roll for an attack that targets this general.

COMMAND ABILITY
Astral Conjunction: Celestial Warbringers
read the
stars to boost their already potent magical powers.

You can use this command ability in your hero
phase. If you do so, pick a friendly CELESTIAL
WARBRINGERS WIZARD wholly within 9" of a

friendly CELESTIAL WARBRINGERS HERO, or wholly

within 18" of a friendly CELESTIAL WARBRINGERS
HERO that is a general. Add 1 to casting rolls for that
unit until the end of that phase.

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first CELESTIAL WARBRINGERS HERO to receive

an artefact of power must be given the Hammers
of Augury.

Hammers of Augur y : These potent tools of divination
orbit their bearer,
lashing out at nearby foes.

At the end of the combat phase, you can pick 1 enemy
unit within 3" of the bearer and roll a dice. On a
3+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound and you can
roll another dice. On a 4+, that unit suffers 1 extra
mortal wound.

TEMPEST LORDS

The Tempest Lords are not only warriors, but also rulers, lords and grand strategists who were born to lead.
Where a conventional army wins battles, the Tempest Lords win wars, leaving a foundation of victory upon which
the spires of civilisation can be built anew.

Tempest Lords

The clarion call of heralds and the boom of the storm
announce the coming of the Tempest Lords. Resplendent
in the blues and whites of Azyr, Tempest Lords make
for a majestic sight – whether they are marching in
phalanxes upon the field of battle or deciding the fates
of nations from ornate thrones. They are diplomats as
well as gifted warriors, and they have achieved success
in many a conquest through words alone. The Tempest
Lords seek to set a laudable example to those around
them at all times, and their leaders fight all the harder
when their allies and kinsmen look to them – whether
they be fellow Stormcast Eternals or mortal soldiers.

This noble Stormhost has already helped forge the new
nations of Order : it has integrated the Heavens-sent
forces of Sigmar with those of the Free People, turned
the rag-tag survivors of downtrodden nations into
strong and motivated armies, and worked hard to allay
the rumours that those of the Stormhosts are not truly
human – at least for a time. They are most renowned for
their leadership skills; many an inspired leap of logic
or lateral-thinking tactic has seen this Stormhost turn
defeat into rousing victory on the battlefield. They fight
hard with hammer and shield in defence of their people,
though they wi l l send their allies in to face impossible
odds without hesitation if it benefits the greater works of
the God-King.

ABILITIES
Grand Strategists: The Tempest Lords have an innate
grasp of the flow of battle, allowing them to adapt to
any situation at great speed.

At the start of your hero phase, roll a dice. On a 4+ you
receive 1 extra command point.

COMMAND TRAIT

A TEMPEST LORDS general must have this command
trait instead of one listed on page 118.

Bonds of Noble Duty : When surrounded by their
kin, the leaders of the Tempest Lords set a per fect
mar tial example.

COMMAND ABILITY
Rousing Oratory : The inspiring speeches of the
Tempest Lords’ commanders drives their forces to ever
greater feats of arms.

You can use this command ability at the start of the
combat phase. If you do so, pick a friendly TEMPEST
LORDS unit wholly within 9" of a friendly TEMPEST
LORDS HERO, or wholly within 18" of a friendly
TEMPEST LORDS HERO that is a general. You can re-
roll wound rolls of 1 for attacks made by that unit until
your next hero phase.

Add 1 to wound rolls for attacks made with this
general’s melee weapons while this general is within 6"
of any other friendly TEMPEST LORDS units.

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first TEMPEST LORDS HERO to receive an artefact
of power must be given the Patrician’s Helm.

Patrician’s Helm: The sacred relics of the Tempest
Lords are imbued with an aura of authority and
command that magnifies that of the wearer.

If the bearer is on the battlefield, each time you spend
a command point, roll a dice. On a 5+ you receive 1
extra command point.

Astral Templars

ASTRAL TEMPLARS

Hunters and monster-killers, the Astral Templars are more at home in the wilderness than the city. They hail from
tribes that once fought giant beasts to survive – though now their skills are put to even better use. Clad in furs
adorned with skulls and totems, they have a barbaric appearance, but their valour is proven in battle every day.

133

The Astral Templars live by the common Ghurish belief
that the best way to destroy a serpent is to cut off its head.
They know well that the hordes of the Dark Gods are
without number, as are the teeming tribes that worship
Gorkamorka and the undead hosts ruled over by Nagash.
Most of them have seen their native lands overrun, or
even destroyed by the tide of anarchy that assails the
realms. With that knowledge has come the realisation
that they cannot possibly meet their foe toe-to-toe and
hope to prevail. Instead, they strike hard, fast and sure
at the leaders of the enemy armies and the monstrous
creatures bound to their cause. By hunting such targets
to extinction, they rob the foe of leadership, cohesion
and even hope. The lesser warriors of an army wi l l often
fall apart in the face of such an onslaught,
lacking the
courage or conviction to continue.

With their path shown true by their gifted Vanguard
Chambers, the Astral Templars rip out the enemy’s
throat, then leave it to bleed and die in their wake.
Many Astral Templars take the bear as their totem
for its endurance and strength, for to take down the
fiercest of prey even a sharp blade needs the might of a
champion to drive it. Their leaders revel in the glory of
the prize kill, with some going to war in plates of blood-
blessed sigmarite so thick they can blunt the claws of a
ravening behemoth.

ABILITIES
Beast Stalkers: The Astral Templars are experienced
hunters of the most horrific creatures the Mortal
Realms have to offer.

Add 1 to hit rolls for attacks made by ASTRAL
TEMPLARS units that target a MONSTER .

COMMAND ABILITY
Cut off the Head: The Astral Templars are renowned
for seeking glory in the midst of battle, often neglecting
lesser foes in favour of a greater challenge.

You can use this command ability at the start of
the combat phase. If you do so, pick an ASTRAL
TEMPLARS unit that is wholly within 9" of a friendly
ASTRAL TEMPLARS HERO, or wholly within 18" of a
friendly ASTRAL TEMPLARS HERO that is a general.
Until the end of that phase, add 1 to wound rolls for

attacks made by that unit that target a HERO.

COMMAND TRAIT

An ASTRAL TEMPLARS general must have this
command trait instead of one listed on page 118.

Dauntless Hunters: The Astral Templars do not often
seek permission to rush headlong at the foe, but their
commanders relish giving it anyway.

After set-up is complete, but before the battle begins,
friendly ASTRAL TEMPLARS units wholly within 12"
of this general can move up to 6".

ARTEFACT OF POWER

The first ASTRAL TEMPLARS HERO to receive an

artefact of power must be given the Godbeast Plate.

Godbeast Plate: This armour, quenched in the blood of
the mightiest beasts, is proof against the raking claws of
feral creatures.

Subtract 1 from wound rolls for attacks made by a
MONSTER that target the bearer.

BATTLEPLAN

AVENGING STRIKE

As the thunder crashes overhead,
the Stormcast Eternals arrive to
deliver justice to the oppressors of
the Mortal Realms. Striding from
the lightning bolts, the warriors
of the Stormhosts surround their
enemies, their objective pure and
simple – the annihilation of the
enemies of Sigmar. The fiends that
oppose them must tr y to destroy
the Azyrite hosts before them – or,
failing that, break out of this trap
and escape.

THE ARMIES

Each player picks an army as
described in the core rules. One
player is the Stormcast Eternals
player and their opponent is
the Fiend player. The Stormcast
Eternals player must use a Stormcast
Eternals army.

Each army has a unique command
ability, as follows.

STORMCAST ETERNALS
COMMAND ABILITY

No Mercy : Your general exhor ts their
warriors to strike unceasingly, even
as the enemy turns tail.

You can use this command ability
at the start of the enemy battleshock
phase. If you do so, pick a friendly

STORMCAST ETERNAL unit wholly

within 6" of a friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL HERO, or wholly within
12" of a friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL HERO that is a general. If
an enemy unit fails a battleshock test
within 3" of that unit, add D3 to the
number of models that flee.

FIEND COMMAND ABILITY

Flee!: Seeing the turning of the tide,
your general makes all haste to
escape the sudden ambush, and their
warriors follow their lead.

You can use this command ability at
the start of your movement phase.
If you do so, pick a friendly unit
wholly within 6" of a friendly HERO,
or wholly within 12" of a friendly
HERO that is a general. You can
re-roll run rolls for that unit in that
movement phase.

SET-UP

The Fiend player sets up their army
first, wholly within their own
territory. The Stormcast Eternals
player then sets up their army wholly
within their territory, more than 12"
from any enemy units.

LIKE CORNERED
ANIMALS
The fiends do not die easily,
lashing
out with spiteful blows as they are
struck down.

Each time a model from the Fiend
player’s army is slain by an attack
made with a melee weapon, roll a
dice. On a 6+ pick 1 unit from the
Stormcast Eternals player’s army
within 3" of the slain model. That
unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

ESCAPE
Breaking through the Stormcast lines,
the exultant fiends flee into the dark.

At the start of the Fiend player’s
hero phase, any units from the Fiend
player’s army that are wholly within
5" of the edge of the battlefield, and
more than 3" from any enemy units,
can escape the battle. Remove the
models in those units from play, but
do not count them as being slain.

BATTLEPLAN

IN SIGMAR’S NAME

An army of invading marauders
is threatening to storm a fledgling
city of Order with the goal of
pillaging its riches and slaughtering
its inhabitants. The only thing that
stands between this invading horde
and the city ’s gates is an army of
Stormcast Eternals. Girded with
the power of the Heavens, they
must prevent the enemies of Sigmar
from defiling this haven and
making off with its treasures.

THE ARMIES

Each player picks an army as

player is the Stormcast Eternals
player and their opponent is the
Marauder player. The Stormcast
Eternals player must use a Stormcast
Eternals army.

Each army has a unique command
ability, as follows.

STORMCAST ETERNALS
COMMAND ABILITY

Let None Pass: The general orders
their warriors to stand firm and bar
the marauder’s path.

You can use this command ability
at the start of the enemy movement
phase. If you do so, pick a friendly

STORMCAST ETERNAL unit wholly

within 6" of a friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL HERO, or wholly within
12" of a friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL HERO that is a general.
Enemy units cannot pass across or
finish a move within 6" of that unit
in that movement phase.

MARAUDER COMMAND
ABILITY

Brook No Delay : Your general’s

orders are clear – these warriors
are an irrelevance, and should be
swept aside so that the plundering
might commence.

You can use this command ability at
the start of your charge phase. If you
do so, pick a friendly HERO. You can
re-roll charge rolls for friendly units
that start that phase wholly within
12" of that HERO.

SET-UP

The players alternate setting up
units one at a time, starting with
the Marauder player. Marauder
units must be set up wholly within
their territory. Stormcast Eternals
units must be set up wholly within
their territory.

Continue to set up units until both
players have set up their armies. If
one player finishes first, the opposing
player can set up the rest of the units
in their army, one after another.

FIRST TURN

The Marauder player takes the first
turn in the first battle round.

GETTING AWAY WITH
THE PRIZE
Plunder has great value to many
of the enemies of Sigmar. From
enchanted trinkets to precious
metals, all are worth taking.

At the start of the Marauder player’s
hero phase, any Marauder units that
are wholly within 5" of the western
edge of the battlefield, and more
than 3" from any enemy units, can
escape the battle. Remove the models
in those units from play, but do not

PATH TO
GLORY

138

PATH TO GLORY

Path to Glory campaigns centre around collecting and fighting battles with a warband in the Age of Sigmar.
Champions fight each other and gather followers to join them in their quest for glory, taking advantage of this age
of unending battle to win glory and renown.

In order to take part in a Path to
Glory campaign, you wi l l need two
or more players. All players wi l l
need to have at least one HERO,
who is their champion, and must
then create a warband to follow and
fight beside their champion during
the campaign.

The players fight battles against each
other using the warbands they have
created. The results of these battles
wi l l gain their warband favour. The
warband wi l l swell in numbers as
more warriors flock to their banner,
while existing troops become
more powerful.

After gaining enough favour or
growing your warband enough to
dominate all others through sheer
weight of numbers, you wi l l be
granted a final test. Succeed, and
your glory wi l l be affirmed for all
time, and you wi l l be crowned as the
victor of the campaign.

CREATING A WARBAND

When creating a Path to Glory
warband, do not select your army in
the normal manner. Instead, your
army consists of a mighty champion
battling to earn the favour of the
gods, and their entire band of loyal
followers. As you wage war against
other warbands, your own warband
wi l l grow, and existing units wi l l
become grizzled veterans.

WARBAND ROSTER

The details and progress of each
warband need to be recorded
on a warband roster, which
you can download for free
from games-workshop.com.

To create a warband, simply follow
these steps and record the results on
your warband roster :

1. First, pick an allegiance for your
warband. Each allegiance has its
own set of warband tables that
are used to generate the units

in the warband and the rewards
they can receive for fighting
battles. The warband tables
included in this battletome let
you collect a warband with the
Stormcast Eternals allegiance,
but other Warhammer Age of
Sigmar publications include
warband tables to let you collect
other warbands from the Grand
Alliances of Order, Chaos, Death
and Destruction.

Reward, or one of your units can
start with a Follower’s Reward.
No champion or unit can start the
Path to Glory campaign with more
than one reward each.

6. Finally,
give your warband a
name, one that wi l l inspire respect
and dread in your rivals. Your
warband is now complete, and
you can fight your first battle.
Good luck!

2. Next, choose your warband’s
champion by selecting one of the
options from your allegiance’s
champion table. The champion
you choose wi l l determine the
number of followers in your
warband. Give your champion a
suitably grand name, and write
this down on your warband roster.

3. Having picked your champion,
the next step is to generate your
starting followers. These can
be chosen from the followers
tables for your allegiance. If your
allegiance has more than one
followers table you can freely
choose which ones you use,
selecting all of your followers
from a single table or from several.
Instead of choosing, you can place
your destiny in the hands of fate
and roll on the followers tables
instead. To make a followers roll,
pick a column from one of the
followers tables and then roll
a dice.

4. Your
followers need to be
organised into units. The follower
table tells you how many models
the unit has. Follower units
cannot include additional models,
but they can otherwise take any
options listed on their warscroll.
Record all of the information
about your followers on your
warband roster.

5. Instead of generating a unit of
followers, your champion can start
the campaign with a Champion’s

TO WAR!

Having created a warband, you can
now fight battles with it against
other warbands taking part in the
campaign. You can fight battles as
and when you wish, and can use
any of the battleplans available for
Warhammer Age of Sigmar. There
are some battleplans, for example in

the General’s Handbook , that have

been designed specifically for use in
Path to Glory campaigns.

The units you use for a game must
be those on your roster. Units can
either be fielded at their fu l l roster
strength, or broken down into
smaller units, as long as no unit
is smaller than the minimum size
shown on its warscroll.

Any casualties suffered by a warband
are assumed to have been replaced
in time for its next battle. If your
champion is slain in a battle,
it is
assumed that they were merely
injured, and they are back to fu l l
strength for your next game, thirsty
for vengeance!

GAINING GLORY

All of the players in the campaign
are vying for glory. The amount
of glory they have received is
represented by the Glory Points that
the warband has accumulated. Glory
can be increased by fighting and
winning battles, as described next.
As a warband’s glory increases, it
wi l l also attract additional followers,


PAGEBREAK
and a warband’s champion may be
granted rewards.

Warbands receive Glory Points after
a battle is complete. If the warband
drew or lost the battle,
it receives 1
Glory Point. If it won the battle,
it
receives D3 Glory Points (re-roll a
result of 1 if it won a major victory).

Add the Glory Points you scored to
the total recorded on your roster.
Once you have won 10 Glory Points,
you wi l l have a chance to win the
campaign, as described below.

REWARDS OF BATTLE

Each allegiance has its own set of
rewards tables. After each battle you
can take one of the three following
options. Alternatively, roll a D3 to
determine which option to take:

D3

1

Option

Additional Followers: More

followers flock to your banner.
Either select a new unit or
roll for a random one from
a follower table, then add it
to your warband roster. You
can choose from any of your
own follower tables, or from
any of the follower tables
from an allied warband table
i.e. a warband table whose

allegiance is from the same
Grand Alliance as your own.
In either case, if you wish to
add a unit from a follower
table that requires more than
‘1 roll’, you must also reduce
your Glory Points total by 1 (if
you do not have enough Glory
Points, you cannot choose a
unit from such a table). Once
5 new units have joined your
warband, you wi l l have a
chance to win the campaign,
as described below.

Champion’s Reward: Your

champion’s prowess grows.
Roll on your allegiance’s
champion rewards table. Note
the result on your warband
roster. If you roll a result
the champion has already
received, roll again until you
get a different result.

Follower’s Reward: Your

warriors become renowned
for mighty deeds. Pick a unit
of followers (not one from an
allied warband table), then roll
on your allegiance’s
followers
rewards table. Note the result
on your warband roster. If
you roll a result the unit has
already received, roll again
until you get a different result.

139

ETERNAL GLORY

There are two ways to win a Path
to Glory campaign; either by Blood
or by Might. To win by Blood
your warband must first have 10
Glory Points. To win by Might
your warband must have at least
5 additional units of followers. In
either case, you must then fight
and win one more battle to win the
campaign. If the next battle you fight
is tied or lost, you do not receive
any Glory Points – just keep on
fighting battles until you either win
the campaign… or another player
wins first!

You can shorten or lengthen a
campaign by lowering or raising
the number of Glory Points needed
to win by Blood, or the number of
extra units that must join a warband
to win by Might. For example, for a
shorter campaign, you could say that
a warband only needs 5 Glory Points
before the final fight, or for a longer
one, say that 15 are needed.

Once per battle,
if this unit is more than 3"

This unit never has to take battleshock tests.

Furious Avengers: Driven forth by their
hatred of the foe, these warriors charge out

phase, this unit cannot run or charge, but you
can re-roll failed save rolls for attacks that target
this unit.

Smite: These warriors are the deliverers of

deadly lightning that smite any foes who dare to
draw near.

Once per battle,
in your hero phase, you can
pick an enemy unit and roll a dice for each
model from this unit that is within 3" of that
unit; for each roll of 4+ the enemy unit suffers 1
mortal wound.

Hardened Veterans: These determined

Stormcasts are fortified by the experience of
having fought on dozens of battlefields.

model passed across. You can add 1 to hit rolls
for attacks made with missile weapons used by
friendly STORMCAST ETERNAL units that
target that unit in the same turn.

Cycle of the Storm: A Lord-Arcanum is capable
of capturing the soul-stuff of a fallen Stormcast
Eternal, returning it back to the battlefield to
continue the fight.

Once per turn, when a friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL model is slain within 18" of this
model, instead of removing the slain model, you
can heal 1 wound allocated to it. This model
cannot use this ability on itself.

Meteoric Strike: A Tauralon descends from the
skies without warning, smashing into the foe with
its horned head lowered.

Roll a dice for each enemy unit that is within 1"
of this model after this model makes a charge
move. On a 2+ that unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

Righteous Indignation: When roused to wrath,

Aventis channels that anger into his magical
powers, blasting the foe.

Pyroelectric Blast: By combining the magic of
Aqshy and Azyr, Aventis can channel a blast of
power that can melt even solid stone.

Each time a wound inflicted by a melee weapon
is allocated to this model, roll a dice. On a 5+ the
attacking unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

Spirit Flask: As a desperate last resor t, Lord-
Arcanums can smash open one or more of the
filled spirit flasks that they carry, causing a deadly
explosion of soul energy that engulfs the wizard
and anybody that is nearby.

Once per battle, at the start of the combat phase,
you can say that this model wi l l shatter 1, 2 or
3 spirit flasks. If you do so, each unit within 3"
of this model suffers 1 mortal wound for each
spirit flask that was shattered. Units within 3"

for each spirit flask that was shattered instead.
Allocate the mortal wounds to this model last of

are affected.

Thunderhead Crown: Aventis’ helm taps into the
Anvil of the Apotheosis, renewing him, even in the
thick of battle.

In your hero phase, heal 1 wound allocated to
this model.

MAGIC

Aventis Firestrike is a WIZARD. He can attempt
to cast two spells in your hero phase, and
attempt
to unbind two spells in the enemy hero
phase. He knows the Arcane Bolt, Mystic Shield
and Pyroelectric Blast spells. In addition, the
Arcane Bolts that he unleashes are fuelled by
Prime Electrids.

Pyroelectric Blast has a casting value of 6. If
successfully cast, pick a point on the battlefield
within 9" of the caster that is visible to them.
Draw an imaginar y line 1mm wide between that
point and the closest part of the caster. Each
unit, apart from the caster,
that has any models
beneath this line suffers D3 mortal wounds.

Prime E lectrids: With the power of Azyr
crackling through them, Lord-Arcanums can
summon lightning as easily as another mor tal
draws breath.

If this model successfully casts Arcane Bolt
and it is not unbound, then the spell inflicts
D3 mortal wounds instead of 1, or D6 mortal
wounds instead of D3 if the casting roll was 10+.

COMMAND ABILITIES

Fiery Orator : Aventis Firestrike’s
rousing
commands can inflame the righteous fury of his
followers, pushing them to ever greater heights
of aggression.

You can use this command ability at the start of
the combat phase. If you do so, pick a friendly
HAMMERS OF SIGMAR unit wholly within 12"
of a friendly model with this command ability.
Add 1 to wound rolls for attacks made by that

MOUNT: This model’s Gryph-charger attacks
with its Razor Beak and Claws.

ABILITIES

Aethereal Strike: A Gryph-charger’s

claws are
supernaturally sharp, tearing through armour
with ease.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with a Gryph-charger’s Razor Beak and Claws
is 6, that attack inflicts 1 mortal wound on the
target and the attack sequence ends (do not make
a wound or save roll).

Cycle of the Storm: A Lord-Arcanum is capable
of capturing the soul-stuff of a fallen Stormcast
Eternal, returning it back to the battlefield to
continue the fight.

Once per turn, when a friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL model is slain within 18" of this
model, instead of removing the slain model, you
can heal 1 wound allocated to it. This model
cannot use this ability on itself.

Ride the Winds Aetheric: Gryph-chargers can

move faster than the eye can follow along the
winds aetheric, though the shifting of these winds
makes such movement perilous at times.

In your movement phase, this model can Ride
the Winds Aetheric instead of moving normally.
If it does so, choose the direction in which it
wi l l move, and roll 6D6. This model can move
up to a number of inches equal to the result in
the direction chosen, moving over terrain and
other models as if it could fly. It must end the
move more than 3" from enemy models – if this
is impossible,
it cannot move at all. This model
cannot charge in a turn in which it Rides the
Winds Aetheric.

Spirit Flask: As a desperate last resor t, Lord-
Arcanums can smash open one or more of the
filled spirit flasks that they carry, causing a deadly
explosion of soul energy that engulfs the wizard
and anybody that is nearby.

Once per battle, at the start of the combat phase,
you can say that this model wi l l shatter 1, 2 or
3 spirit flasks. If you do so, each unit within 3"
of this model suffers 1 mortal wound for each
spirit flask that was shattered. Units within 3"
with 10 or more models suffer D3 mortal wounds
for each spirit flask that was shattered instead.
Allocate the mortal wounds to this model last of
all, after allocating them to any other units that
are affected.

MAGIC

This model is a WIZARD. It can attempt
to
cast one spell in your hero phase, and attempt
to unbind one spell in the enemy hero phase.
It knows the Arcane Bolt, Mystic Shield and
Healing Light spells. In addition, the Arcane
Bolts that this model unleashes are fuelled by
Prime Electrids.

Healing L ight: The Lord-Arcanum gathers
aetheric energy and uses it to revitalise the
depleted life energies of Stormcast warriors that
are nearby.

Healing Light has a casting value of 5. If
successfully cast, pick a friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL model within 18" of the caster. Heal
D3 wounds that have been allocated to that
model. If the casting roll was 8+, heal D6 wounds
that have been allocated to that model instead.

Prime E lectrids: With the power of Azyr
crackling through them, Lord-Arcanums can
summon lightning as easily as another mor tal
draws breath.

If this model successfully casts Arcane Bolt

D3 mortal wounds instead of 1, or D6 mortal
wounds instead of D3 if the casting roll was 10+.

COMMAND ABILITIES

Soul Energy : A Lord-Arcanum can enhance
the soul energy of nearby units from the
Sacrosanct Chamber, allowing them to per form
extraordinary deeds.

You can use this command ability in your hero
phase, your shooting phase, or the combat phase.

Hero Phase: If you use this command ability
in your hero phase, pick a friendly unit of
EVOCATORS wholly within 9" of a friendly
model with this command ability. That unit can
automatically cast Empower in that hero phase
(no casting roll is required, and the spell cannot
be unbound).

Shooting Phase: If you use this command ability
in your shooting phase, pick a friendly unit of
CASTIGATORS wholly within 9" of a friendly
model with this command ability. You can use
Aetheric Channelling to increase the accuracy
and power of that unit’s Thunderhead Greatbows
in that shooting phase instead of choosing only
one of those options.

Combat Phase: If you use this command ability
in the combat phase, pick a friendly unit of
SEQUITORS wholly within 9" of a friendly
model with this command ability. You can
use Aetheric Channelling to increase the
power of the unit’s weapons and shields in that
combat phase instead of choosing only one of
those options.

COMMAND ABILITY

Lord of the Azyrite Hurricane: The Lord-

Aquilor directs their warriors to fade and strike
from an unexpected direction, whirling around
the enemy like a cyclone.

You can use this command ability at the end
of your movement phase. If you do so, pick
a friendly model with this command ability.
Remove that model, and/or one friendly unit

of VANGUARD-HUNTERS , VANGUARD-
PALLADORS , VANGUARD-RAPTORS or

AETHERWINGS wholly within 24" of that
model, from the battlefield and set them up
wholly within 6" of any edge of the battlefield,
more than 7" from any enemy units.

Ride the Winds Aetheric: Gryph-chargers can

move faster than the eye can follow along the
winds aetheric, though the shifting of these winds
makes such movement perilous at times.

In your movement phase, this model can Ride
the Winds Aetheric instead of moving normally.
If it does so, choose the direction in which it
wi l l move, and roll 6D6. This model can move
up to a number of inches equal to the result in
the direction chosen, moving over terrain and
other models as if it could fly. It must end the
move more than 3" from enemy models – if this
is impossible,
it cannot move at all. This model
cannot charge in a turn in which it Rides the
Winds Aetheric.

DESCRIPTION

A Lord-Aquilor is a single model armed with
a Starbound Blade, a Shock Handaxe and a
Heavy Boltstorm Pistol. It can also carr y an
Astral Compass.

MOUNT: This model’s Gryph-charger attacks
with its Razor Beak and Claws.

ABILITIES

Aethereal Strike: A Gryph-charger’s

claws are
supernaturally sharp, tearing through armour
with ease.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with a Gryph-charger’s Razor Beak and Claws
is 6, that attack inflicts 1 mortal wound on the
target and the attack sequence ends (do not make
a wound or save roll).

Astral Compass: The astral compass shows the
best route to strike at the foe.

If you set up this model in the Celestial Realm
using the Scions of the Storm battle trait, when
you set it up on the battlefield for the first time,
instead of setting it up more than 9" from the
enemy, you can set it up wholly within 6" of
any edge of the battlefield, more than 7" from
the enemy.

COMMAND ABILITY

Lord of the Host: A Lord-Celestant
is a trusted
and respected leader. Their presence steels the
souls of those who fight nearby.

You can use this command ability at the start
of the battleshock phase. If you do so, pick a
friendly model with this command ability. Until
the end of that phase, you do not have to take
battleshock tests for friendly STORMCAST
ETERNAL units that are wholly within 24" of
that model.

Stormstrike Glaive: By lowering a stormstrike
glaive and wielding it as a lance, a Lord-Celestant
can bring down the mightiest
foes.

Add 2 to the Damage characteristic of this
model’s Stormstrike Glaive if this model made a
charge move in the same turn.

Storm Breath: Dracoths can unleash the power of
Sigmar’s
storm from within their maws.

In your shooting phase, you can pick a point on
the battlefield within 12" of this model that is
visible to them. Roll a dice for each enemy unit
within 2" of that point. On a 4+ that unit suffers
D3 mortal wounds.

Tempestos Hammer : With the momentum of
the charge behind it, the impact of a tempestos
hammer can fell a rampaging Ghorgon.

Add D3 to the Attacks characteristic of this
model’s Tempestos Hammer if this model made
a charge move in the same turn.

Thunderaxe: In the capable hands of a
Lord-Celestant, a thunderaxe draws on
celestial energies until
it crackles with barely
contained power.

Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of this
model’s Thunderaxe for each other friendly
Stormcast Eternal unit wholly within 9" of this
model when the attack is made.

DESCRIPTION

A Lord-Celestant on Dracoth is a single model
armed with either a Tempestos Hammer,
a Thunderaxe, a Lightning Hammer, or a
Stormstrike Glaive. They can also carr y a
Sigmarite Thundershield.

MOUNT: This model’s Dracoth attacks with its
Claws and Fangs.

ABILITIES

L ightning Hammer : The shockwave effect of a
lightning hammer connecting with the foe stuns
those in close proximity.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with a Lightning Hammer is 6, that attack
inflicts 2 mortal wounds on the target in
addition to its normal damage. If a unit suffers
any mortal wounds in this way,
it cannot pile in
later that phase.

Intolerable Damage: When a Dracoth catches its
prey,
there is often little left of the victim.

If the unmodified wound roll for an attack made
with a Dracoth’s Claws and Fangs is 6, that
attack has a Damage characteristic of D6 instead
of 1.

Sigmarite Thundershield: Thundershields

store
storm energy, unleashing it when struck with
sufficient
force to blast those attempting to attack.

You can re-roll save rolls of 1 for attacks that
target this model if this model is carr ying a
Sigmarite Thundershield. If the re-rolled save
is successful, each enemy unit within 3" of this
model suffers 1 mortal wound.

A Lord-Celestant on Stardrake is a single
model armed with a Celestine Hammer or a

MOUNT: This model’s Stardrake attacks with its
Great Claws.

FLY: This model can fly.

ABILITIES

Arcane L ineage: Stardrakes are the children of
Dracothion, and they possess innate power over
the magic of the realms.

Add 1 to casting rolls for friendly WIZARDS
while they are within 18" of this model. In
addition, subtract 1 from casting rolls for
enemy WIZARDS while they are within 18" of
this model.

Cavernous Jaws: The enormous maw of a
Stardrake can bite a foe in half.

After this model makes a pile-in move, this
model’s Stardrake can bite one or more enemy
models with its cavernous jaws. The number
of bites it can make is shown on the damage
table above. For each bite, pick one enemy
model within 3" of this model and roll a dice.
If the roll is greater than that model’s Wounds
characteristic,
it is slain.

Inescapable Vengeance: A Lord-Celestant on the

charge is a formidable sight, sundering the foe with
sweeps of his star-blessed weapon.

Stormbound Blade: Stormbound blades are
wreathed in lightning that can arc viciously into
the flesh of those they strike.

Add D3 to the Attacks characteristic of this
model’s Celestine Hammer or Stormbound
Blade if this model made a charge move in the
same turn.

Lord of the Heavens: Stardrakes are imbued with
pure Azyrite energy and the powers of the celestial
realm are theirs to command.

At the start of your shooting phase, if this model
is on the battlefield,
it can either breathe a Roiling
Thunderhead or call down a Rain of Stars.

If it breathes a Roiling Thunderhead, pick 1
enemy unit within 18" of this model that is visible
to it. Roll a dice for each model in that unit that
is within 18" of this model. For each 6+ that unit
suffers 1 mortal wound.

If it calls down a Rain of Stars, pick up to D6
enemy units on the battlefield. Roll a dice for
each unit you pick. On a 4+ that unit suffers D3
mortal wounds.

Sigmarite Thundershield: Thundershields

store
storm energy, unleashing it when struck with
sufficient
force to blast those attempting to attack.

You can re-roll save rolls of 1 for attacks
that target this model. If the re-rolled save is
successful, each enemy unit within 3" of this
model suffers 1 mortal wound.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with
a Stormbound Blade is 6, that attack inflicts 3 hits
on the target instead of 1. Make a wound and save
roll for each hit.

Sweeping Tail: Those who seek to avoid the jaws of
a Stardrake are often smashed by its mighty tail.

Each time this model attacks, roll a dice for each
enemy unit within 3" of this model after all of
this model’s attacks have been resolved. If the roll
is less than the number of models in that enemy
unit, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

COMMAND ABILITY

Lord of the Celestial Host: The Stardrake ridden

by a Lord-Celestant
is more than a mere mount;
it is an intelligent and cunning hunter in its
own right.

You can use this command ability at the start of
the combat phase if a friendly model with this
command ability is on the battlefield. If you do
so, you can re-roll failed wound rolls for attacks
made by friendly STARDRAKE and DRACOTH
mounts until the end of that phase.

can smash the
filled spirit flasks they carry, causing a deadly
explosion of soul energy.

Once per battle, at the start of the combat phase,
you can say that this model wi l l shatter 1, 2 or
3 spirit flasks. If you do so, each unit within 3"
of this model suffers 1 mortal wound for each
spirit flask that was shattered. Units within 3"
with 10 or more models suffer D3 mortal wounds
for each spirit flask that was shattered instead.
Allocate the mortal wounds to this model last of
all, after allocating them to any other units that
are affected.

MAGIC

This model is a WIZARD. It can attempt
to cast
one spell in your hero phase, and attempt
to
unbind one spell in the enemy hero phase. It
knows the Arcane Bolt, Mystic Shield and Spirit
Storm spells.

Spirit Storm: The wizard conjures a whirl of
gusting winds and eldritch lightning.

Spirit Storm has a casting value of 7. If
successfully cast, each enemy unit within 18" of
the caster suffers 1 mortal wound. In addition,
until your next hero phase, subtract 1 from run
and charge rolls for enemy units while they are
within 18" of the caster.

DESCRIPTION

A Drakesworn Templar is a single model armed
with either a Tempest Axe, an Arc Hammer
or a Stormlance. It can also be armed with a
Skybolt Bow.

MOUNT: This model’s Stardrake attacks with its
Great Claws.

FLY: This model can fly.

ABILITIES

Arcane L ineage: Stardrakes are the children of
Dracothion, and they possess innate power over
the magic of the realms.

Add 1 to casting rolls for friendly WIZARDS
while they are within 18" of this model. In
addition, subtract 1 from casting rolls for
enemy WIZARDS while they are within 18" of
this model.

Arc Hammer : The static hum of an arc hammer
rises to an almighty concussive crescendo as
it strikes.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with an Arc Hammer is 6, that attack inflicts 2
hits on the target instead of 1. Make a wound and
save roll for each hit.

Cavernous Jaws: The enormous maw of a
Stardrake can bite a foe in half.

After this model makes a pile-in move, this
model’s Stardrake can bite one or more enemy
models with its cavernous jaws. The number
of bites it can make is shown on the damage

table above. For each bite, pick one enemy
model within 3" of this model and roll a dice.
If the roll is greater than that model’s Wounds
characteristic,
it is slain.

Lord of the Heavens: Stardrakes are imbued with
pure Azyrite energy and the powers of the celestial
realm are theirs to command.

At the start of your shooting phase, if this
model is on the battlefield,
it can either breathe
a Roiling Thunderhead or call down a Rain
of Stars.

If it breathes a Roiling Thunderhead, pick 1
enemy unit within 18" of this model that is
visible to it. Roll a dice for each model in that
unit that is within 18" of this model. For each 6+
that unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

If it calls down a Rain of Stars, pick up to D6
enemy units on the battlefield. Roll a dice for
each unit you pick. On a 4+ that unit suffers D3
mortal wounds.

Skybolt Bow : Drakesworn Templars often direct
attacks with well-placed skybolts.

If you score one or more hits on an enemy unit
with this model’s Skybolt Bow, add 1 to hit rolls
for attacks made by friendly DRACOTHIAN
GUARD units that target that enemy unit until
the end of that turn.

Stormlance: A well-placed blow from a
stormlance channels the power of Sigmar into the
unfortunate v ictim.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with a Stormlance that targets a MONSTER is
6, that attack inflicts D6 mortal wounds on the
target and the attack sequence ends (do not make
a wound or save roll).

Sweeping Tail: Those who seek to avoid the jaws
of a Stardrake are often smashed aside by its
mighty tail.

Each time this model attacks, roll a dice for
each enemy unit within 3" of this model after
all of this model’s attacks have been resolved.
If the roll is less than the number of models in
that enemy unit, that enemy unit suffers D3
mortal wounds.

Tempest Axe: The hurricane force emanating
from a tempest axe is enough to slow the
foe’s attack.

Subtract 2" from the distance enemy units can
pile in when they start that pile-in move within
3" of this model.

wounds in this way,
it cannot pile in later

PALLADOR-PRIME : The leader of this unit is a
Pallador-Prime. A Pallador-Prime is armed with
a Lunar Blade in addition to their other weapons.

Aethereal Strike: A Gryph-charger’s

claws are
supernaturally sharp, tearing through armour
with ease.

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made
with a Gryph-charger’s Razor Beak and Claws
is 6, that attack inflicts 1 mortal wound on the
target and the attack sequence ends (do not make
a wound or save roll).

Lunar Blade: The leaders of Vanguard-Pallador
retinues are entrusted with deadly lunar blades
with which they can unleash devastatingly
swift attacks.

Each time a model armed with a Lunar Blade
attacks, after all of that model’s attacks have been
resolved, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 1" of
that model and roll a dice. On a 2+ the unit you
picked suffers 1 mortal wound.

Ride the Winds Aetheric: Gryph-chargers can

move faster than the eye can follow along the
winds aetheric, though the shifting of these winds
makes such movement perilous at times.

In your movement phase, this unit can Ride the
Winds Aetheric instead of moving normally.
If it does so, choose the direction in which it
wi l l move, and roll 6D6. This unit can move
up to a number of inches equal to the result in
the direction chosen, moving over terrain and

CELESTIAN VORTEX

A Celestian Vortex is a whirling tornado of Azyrite magic. Borne aloft within it are magical hammers cast in the image
of Ghal Maraz, the Great Shatterer. Anyone in the vortex’s path are hurled, smashed and broken, into the dirt .

DESCRIPTION

A Celestian Vortex is a single model.

PREDATORY: A Celestian Vortex is a predatory
endless spell. A Celestian Vortex can move up to
8" and can fly.

MAGIC

Summon Celestian Vortex: The wizard casts a

pair of ensorcelled hammers into the air, which
begin to spin. As the vor tex gets more intense,
the hammers multiply to form a maelstrom of
skull-crushing force.

Summon Celestian Vortex has a casting value of

6. Only STORMCAST ETERNAL WIZARDS can

attempt
to cast this spell. If successfully cast, set
up a Celestian Vortex model wholly within 12" of
the caster.

Tornado of Magic: A Celestian Vortex whips the
air around it into a tornado that disrupts attacks
made with missile weapons.

Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made with
missile weapons by units while they are within 6"
of this model.

ABILITIES

Swirling Doom: When a Celestian Vortex is
summoned,
it immediately swirls across the
battlefield leaving devastation in its wake.

When this model is set up, the player who set it
up can immediately make a move with it.

Storm of Vengeance: Those caught in this deadly
maelstrom find themselves battered by magical
hammers and crushed by furious Azyrite energy.

After moving this model, you can pick 1 enemy
unit within 1" of this model and roll 12 dice.
For each roll of 6+, that unit suffers 1 mortal
wound. If the unit being rolled for is a CHAOS
unit, it suffers 1 mortal wound for each roll of
5+ instead.

DAIS ARCANUM

A Dais Arcanum can be harnessed by a Stormcast wizard to carr y them across the battlefield. It can bear a rider upon
the winds of Azyr and bolster their mastery of the aetheric arts.

DESCRIPTION

A Dais Arcanum is a single model.

MAGIC

Summon Dais Arcanum: The wizard calls down

a single bolt of lightning which strikes the ground
at their feet,
leaving behind a per fect sigmarite
disc. Alighting upon it, the wizard is carried into
the air.

Summon Dais Arcanum has a casting value of

6. Only STORMCAST ETERNAL WIZARDS

that do not have a Wounds characteristic of 6
or more, are not part of a unit with 2 or more
models, and are not already on a Dais Arcanum,
can attempt
to cast this spell. If successfully
cast, set up a Dais Arcanum model within 1"
of the caster and more than 3" from any enemy
models and then place the caster on top of it.

As long as the Dais Arcanum remains on the
battlefield, the Dais Arcanum and the caster
are treated as a single model from the caster’s
army that uses the caster’s warscroll as well as
the endless spell rules. It is treated as an enemy
model by the opposing player’s army.

A model on a Dais Arcanum has a Move
characteristic of 12" and can fly.

If a model on a Dais Arcanum is slain, that Dais
Arcanum is immediately dispelled and removed
from play along with the slain model.

If a Dais Arcanum is dispelled and the model on
it has not been slain, set up that model wholly
within 6" of the Dais Arcanum and more than
3" from any enemy models, and then remove the
Dais Arcanum from play. If it is impossible to
set up that model, it is slain.

ABILITIES

Arcane Enhancement: The magical energies of
a Dais Arcanum are attuned with those of the
wizard that rides upon it.

While a model is on a Dais Arcanum,
it can
attempt
to unbind one extra spell in each enemy
hero phase.

In addition, if a model on a Dais Arcanum
attempts to dispel that Dais Arcanum, the
attempt
is automatically successful (do not roll
any dice).

Winds of Azyr : The Dais Arcanum glides on
arcane currents to evade incoming attacks.

While a model is on a Dais Arcanum, add 1 to
save rolls for attacks that target that model.

EVERBLAZE COMET

To summon an Everblaze Comet is to pick a shooting star from the firmament and draw it down to crash into the
enemy lines with devastating impact. Such astral projectiles burn on, pulsing with celestial force even after landing.

DESCRIPTION

An Everblaze Comet is a single model.

MAGIC

Summon Everblaze Comet: Reaching an arm to

the heavens, the wizard calls down a pure comet
of Azyrite energy. Radiating the pure light of
Sigmar’s
realm,
it crashes into the foe’s
ranks with
devastating effect.

Summon Everblaze Comet has a casting value of

6. Only STORMCAST ETERNAL WIZARDS can

attempt
to cast this spell. If successfully cast, set
up an Everblaze Comet model wholly within 36"
of the caster.

Arcane Disruption: The emanations from an
Everblaze Comet disrupt the arcane abilities of
nearby w izards.

Subtract 1 from casting rolls for WIZARDS
while they are within 5" of this model.

ABILITIES

Burning Vengeance: An Everblaze Comet

smashes into the battlefield with tremendous
force, whereupon it embeds itself
into the ground,
radiating a corona of deadly Azyrite energies.

After this model is set up, roll a dice for each
unit within 10" of this model. On a 1-2, that
unit suffers 1 mortal wound. On a 3-4, that unit
suffers D3 mortal wounds. On a 5-6, that unit
suffers 3 mortal wounds.

In addition, at the start of each battle round, roll
a dice for each unit within 5" of this model. On a
1-3, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound. On a 4-6,
that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

PITCHED BATTLE PROFILES

The table below provides points, minimum and maximum unit sizes, and battlefield roles for the warscrolls and
warscroll battalions in this book, for use in Pitched Battles. Spending the points listed on this table allows you to
take a minimum-sized unit with any of its upgrades. Understrength units cost the fu l l amount of points. Larger
units are taken in multiples of their minimum unit size; multiply their cost by the same amount as you multiplied
their size. If a unit has two points values separated by a slash (e.g. ‘60/200’), the second value is for a maximum
sized unit. Units that are listed as ‘Unique’ are named characters and can only be taken once in an army. A unit
that has any of the keywords listed on the Allies table can be taken as an allied unit by a Stormcast Eternals army.
